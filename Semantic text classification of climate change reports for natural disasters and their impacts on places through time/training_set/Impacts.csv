ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Endangered species are especially vulnerable when habitat is destroyed. Water quality is impacted when sewage treatment facilities flood or debris enters reservoirs and waterways. Beaches move and change shape due to storm surges. Riverbanks erode during flash flood events. The end of a disaster is often just the beginning. Once the storm abates, the smoke clears, and the dust settles, the recovery process begins. In addition to the billions of dollars in property loss and the deep personal loss that many people endure, there are often unseen environmental impacts that have to be mitigated. As we witnessed this fall, hurricanes can be among the most devastating natural disasters. According to the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program, hurricanes account for two thirds of property losses nationwide. But beyond property, natural habitats take a significant beating. In August, Hurricane Harvey dumped an estimated 27 trillion gallons of rain over Texas and Louisiana during a six-day period, according to WeatherBELL, a meteorological analytics company. Harvey also set a record for the most rainfall ever from a tropical storm in the continental US, at 51 inches. On Harvey’s heels came Hurricane Irma, which wreaked havoc across the Caribbean and into Florida and the Southeast, then Hurricane Maria, which caused nearly everyone in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands to lose power for weeks. Each of these storms greatly upset the natural ecosystem, significantly disrupting coastal native shellfish, fish, insect, bird, and mammal habitat.  Pollutants from flooded industrial sites caused hazardous chemicals to enter untreated into project sites, groundwater, watersheds and the oceans. In the urban landscape, natural disasters can impact historic structures, leading to the need for restoration and preservation work. Infrastructure such as bridges, roads, transmission lines, and oil and gas pipelines may need new permits, assessment and repair. Home and commercial building repairs may first require the identification of asbestos, mold, or lead hazards. As mentioned, events that societies label as natural ''disasters"" may also have beneficial ecological consequences. However, these benefits tend to only manifest themselves months or years after an extreme event (e.g., rejuvenation of a coniferous forest months and/or years after fires), or are often not readily apparent (e.g., recharging of groundwater stocks after a flood). These benefits to ecological systems are of course typically overshadowed by immediate, negative impacts on societies and structures; hence, the use of the term natural ""disasters."""
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Other disasters such as wildfires, floods, and tornadoes can completely defoliate forests and cause other types of structural changes to ecosystems. Wildlife can be killed by the force of the disaster or impacted indirectly through changes in habitat and food availability. Endangered species are especially vulnerable when habitat is destroyed. Water quality is impacted when sewage treatment facilities flood or debris enters reservoirs and waterways. Beaches move and change shape due to storm surges. Riverbanks erode during flash flood events. The good news? With smart, responsive recovery efforts, environmental planning and mitigation, adverse impacts can be minimized, ecosystems can recover, and infrastructure can be repaired and improved to withstand future storms. We know disaster recovery is possible, because we’ve seen it in action. Many of our Houston office staff recently implemented it personally after Hurricane Harvey. In the past, SWCA has helped clients restore historic buildings after devastating storms, finding replacement materials that meet historic preservation requirements. We’ve developed fire recovery plans, led reforestation and wetland restoration efforts, and we’ve overseen permitting and clean-up support following floods. It is recognized that many significant nonmarket effects result from natural disasters, including environmental impacts. Though our committee had a keen interest in these topics, it became clear that these impacts—though often significant—did not fit easily with this study's main report and conclusions for the following reasons: (1) not all disasters result in significant ecosystem impacts (e.g., many earthquakes have but minor impacts on ecosystems); (2) some extreme events have positive impacts on ecosystems (e.g., floods can help rejuvenate floodplain vegetation and are important drivers of many ecological processes in floodplains); and, (3) these impacts are mainly nonmarket and are exceptionally difficult to quantify and/or monetize. Though there are emerging efforts in quantifying and monetizing ecosystem services, they are in their infancy and are not yet widely accepted. It is important in assessing environmental impacts to distinguish between impacts of disasters on the natural environment from those on the human-made landscape environment. Three principles apply to the assessment of the costs and benefits of extreme geophysical events to the nation's ecological systems."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"First, although the more tangible, quantifiable damages of extreme events to infrastructure and economies may be difficult to calculate precisely, the costs to and benefits for natural ecosystems—even from such apparently straightforward impacts as numbers of fish killed or trees destroyed—are even less tangible and may be nearly impossible to quantify precisely. Moreover, even if the physical effects can be measured, the monetary values of those impacts cannot be stated with precision. Second, existing ecological systems have already adapted in many respects to the forces created by extreme events, such as floods or droughts. This process is lengthy, extending over thousands of years and involving the evolution of species and complex physical systems. The effects of geophysical extremes often are not undesirable. For example, major natural disturbances, such as fires or floods, rejuvenate old forests. The critical factors are the frequency, intensity, and extent of natural disturbances. If disturbances occur too frequently and over large areas, then only pioneering, short-lived, and opportunistic species survive. If disturbances occur too infrequently, then slower-growing, superior competitors for light, water, and nutrients replace the pioneers. Maximum diversity is maintained by an intermediate level of disturbance, so that patches of pioneers and superior competitors alike occur within the landscape. All of this suggests that attempts to eliminate natural disturbances (rather than attempts to mitigate their adverse impacts) can be counterproductive and in some cases, as in the 1927 and 1993 floods on the Mississippi River and the Yellowstone fires in 1988, can make a disaster worse. Third, precisely because many disasters are indeed ""natural,"" they often produce mixed outcomes for the environment: benefits to some parts of the natural system and losses to others. "
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Third, precisely because many disasters are indeed ""natural,"" they often produce mixed outcomes for the environment: benefits to some parts of the natural system and losses to others. For example, some thinning of tree branches caused by high winds or ice accumulations from winter storms can allow for subsequent stronger tree development, and studies of the 1993 flood in the Midwest revealed major ecological benefits in the immersed floodplains. To the average human observer, floodplain forests appear to change scarcely at all from year to year, and therefore the death of trees during or after a major flood seems catastrophic. However, the diversity of vegetation on the floodplain is a product of disturbances, such as major fires, droughts, and floods that occur very infrequently in terms of a human life span. Without droughts, floodplains would not get dry enough to burn, and fire-intolerant species would crowd out the wet prairies and trees. Even the most extreme geophysical events are thus not necessarily damaging to ecosystems, and in some circumstances can bring great benefits. Furthermore, the effects take months and years after the disturbance to assess, suggesting that immediate ecological or environmental accountings are prone to error. Finally, as was outlined in the report, it is useful to assess the impacts of natural disasters by type of disasters. Because of their great spatial extent and longevity, major floods and droughts generally create the greatest environmental impacts, whereas earthquakes, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and winter storms cover less territory and their effects on the ecosystem are less pervasive and long-lasting. Below, we briefly review some case studies to illustrate the diverse environmental impacts of different categories of disasters, and the difficulties in precisely quantifying and monetizing these impacts."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"The severe damage from the 1927 flood on the lower Mississippi River and in 1993 in the Upper Mississippi basin could have been substantially reduced if levees bordering the river had neither failed nor been overtopped, and if other forms of mitigation had been adopted. Meanwhile, the Yellowstone fires that occurred during the 1988 drought were worsened because of ""let-it-burn"" and other forest management practices and because fire prediction models at the time were outmoded and inadequate for such an extreme event. Major floods create myriad effects on river-floodplain ecosystems. During periods of low flow, typically in midsummer, the rivers occupy channels. During rainy seasons, rivers spill into their floodplains, recharging the surrounding wetlands, forests, and lakes with fresh supplies of water, nutrients, and sediments. During great floods, floodplains do not merely store water, but become part of the flowing river itself, conveying water slowly downstream through the forests and marshes. Plant and animal species have adapted over time to exploit, tolerate, or escape seasonal floodpulses and exceptional great floods. The combination of the flood-adapted animals and plants, the seasonal flows and great floods, the river and its channels, and the complex patchwork of floodplain habitats constitute the dynamic and phenomenally productive river-floodplain ecosystem. Large river-floodplain ecosystems provide valuable hydrological and ecological services and functions, such as flood storage and conveyance; the maintenance of biodiversity; retention, recycling, and conversion of potentially polluting nutrients into useful biomass; production of fish, wildlife, and forests; and the provisions of corridors for migratory fish and wildlife. Annual floodpulses help regulate and maintain these ecosystems by promoting exchanges of water, sediment, nutrients, and organisms between the rivers and their floodplains. Moreover, infrequent great floods and droughts help maintain habitat and species diversity."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Though the record flood of 1993 in the Upper Midwest was an economic disaster, it was a boon to many plants and animals that lived in and along the Missouri and Upper Mississippi Rivers. Even the few species that appear to have been harmed by the flood, such as some trees, may benefit in the long term. Any harm that did occur may have been more the result of human factors rather than the flood itself, including failure of human-made levees, excessive loading of rivers and the Gulf of Mexico with herbicides and agricultural fertilizers, widespread dispersal of introduced pests, and the excessive drawdown of the Mississippi River after the flood. It is not surprising that the flood of 1993 had both positive and negative effects on the river-floodplain ecosystems. Many mobile organisms have adapted to exploit such seasonal floods. For example, the flood benefited fish that spawned on the inundated floodplain, and wading birds in turn exploited the huge crop of young fish. In contrast, long-lived, stationary organisms, such as trees, were severely stressed or died as a result of the exceptionally long period of inundation. And yet the outcome for trees was not all bad. Many seedlings cannot germinate or grow in the shade of mature trees, so old forests were rejuvenated when mature trees died because of the 1993 flood. Every component of the river-floodplain ecosystem, from the bottom to the top of the food chain, responded to the exceptional flood of 1993. At the shallow margins of the flood, nutrients were apparently released from newly flooded soils, stimulating phytoplankton. Aquatic insects likewise concentrated in the shallow water, perhaps consuming either the plankton or the remains of flooded terrestrial vegetation. Submergent aquatic plants grew in areas where the flood did not persist too long so they could reach sunlight. "
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Where the flood rose higher and lasted longer, submersed aquatic plants virtually disappeared. About 52 species of fishes, representing 15 families, spawned on the floodplain during the flood (Maher, 1995). The abundant juvenile fish became food for larger fish and fish-eating birds, such as herons and egrets. The flood also took a heavy toll on trees, the longest-living organisms in the floodplain. The 1993 flood caused a serious economic and environmental pest, the zebra mussel, to wash from the Upper Illinois River downstream into the lower Illinois and the Mississippi. In the process, zebra mussel larvae were carried far back into the floodplain and upstream into tributaries that were backed up by the mainstream rivers. Another potential pest was introduced when a fish farm on a tributary of the Mississippi flooded and Asian black carp escaped. The carp is able to consume endangered native mussels and clams and competes with the native fish and ducks that already consume zebra mussels. The flood moved tremendous amounts of water to the Gulf of Mexico. Through erosion and flooding of agricultural soils throughout the Midwest, the floodwaters picked up vast quantities of various chemicals, including some from flooded industries along the rivers. Substantial quantities of these agricultural (and other) chemicals were transported into the streams and rivers, either as dissolved matter or in suspension, and into the floodplains. This polluted water infiltrated floodplains and contaminated ground water aquifers. There was an immense discharge of freshwater to the Gulf of Mexico during the summer of 1993. The delivery of this water and its dissolved and suspended materials affected the ecosystem of the Gulf of Mexico. Discharges of herbicides and nitrates to the Gulf of Mexico were substantially higher in 1993 than in prior years, stimulating plankton blooms. When the plankton died and sank, the decaying organic matter used up oxygen in the bottom layer of water, lowering oxygen levels over an area of 6,000 square miles (the so-called ""dead zone"") and threatening valuable fisheries."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"The total amount of atrazine delivered to the Gulf of Mexico by the Mississippi River from April to August 1993 was 1.2 million pounds, up about 25 percent from loads delivered during 1992. One million tons of nitrate-nitrogen were discharged to the Gulf of Mexico from April to August 1993, a value 37 percent larger than loads for 1992. In summary, the flood of 1993 exacerbated two preexisting environmental problems related to human activity. First, it facilitated the spread of a serious economic and environmental pest, the European zebra mussel, that accidentally had previously been introduced to the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes drainage by transoceanic ships (and facilitated other introduced pests, such as the Asian tiger mosquito). Second, nutrient loading of the Gulf of Mexico was substantially increased by the flood, and the summer ""dead zone"" in the Gulf consequently expanded, with potential detrimental impacts on the largest fishery in the United States. At the same time, the 1993 flood also vividly demonstrates the complexity and uncertainty over the range of positive and negative impacts upon floodplain ecosystems, as well as the overwhelming task of trying to distill precise figures for the full costs and benefits of an extreme geophysical event. Unlike floods, droughts generally damage ecological systems and yield few offsetting benefits. In fact, the most subtle and enduring impacts of droughts occur in the environment. The cumulative stress on wetlands, wildlife, forests, ground water, and soils cannot be measured accurately, and many effects occur slowly and over a period of years, making them extremely difficult to quantify. The problems generated by droughts begin with changes in the quantity and quality of water available in the hydrologic system. Drought damages both plant and animal species by depriving them of food and water, increasing their susceptibility to disease, and increasing their vulnerability to predation.  As with floods, droughts produce a loss of biodiversity, and often increase erosion of dried soils when rain eventually comes."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Droughts also degrade water quality, shifting salt concentration, pH levels and dissolved oxygen, while increasing. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. water temperatures. Even air quality is diminished because of increased dust and pollutants. Droughts also lead to more wildfires, while adversely changing salinity levels in coastal estuaries and reducing the flushing of pollutants. Drought of 1988. The best documentation of environmental damages from a drought came from studies of the 1988 drought, which affected large portions of the United States. This event caused enormous reductions in streamflows in two major drought-affected regions. Plans to divert additional water from the Great Lakes to enhance the record low flows of the Upper Mississippi River system were halted by environmental concerns over the potential impacts of lowered water levels on the lakes. Many streams were unable to handle industrial discharges and agricultural pollution, greatly limiting water quality and the use of water. Water supplies dropped to seriously low levels in the southeast United States, where many uses of river waters, including hydropower generation and navigation on major rivers, had to be curtailed. Saltwater intrusion up the Mississippi River beyond New Orleans was so severe that underwater sills were built to halt the intrusion. The 1988 drought led to 68,000 wildfires that burned 5.1 million acres of federal forest land. Fire-fighting costs alone amounted to $300 million. The best-known fires were those in Yellowstone National Park, which captured national attention. The dry conditions in areas adjacent to the fires greatly reduced the number of tree seedlings, with mortality of 40 percent of the trees planted in the 10 years prior to 1988, including 150 million pine seedlings. The drought led to increased insect attacks on commercial forests, and 5.7 billion board feet of lumber were lost because of pine bark beetles. The total loss to U.S. forests was estimated at $5 billion. The 1988 drought also caused sizable but unmeasured losses of fish, waterfowl, and wildlife. High water temperatures in bays along the East Coast caused an increase in oyster diseases, resulting in an 1988 harvest of 375 million bushels, the lowest on record for Chesapeake Bay."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Hurricanes and tropical storms create environmental damages within paths that vary from 50 to 150 miles in width. The environmental consequences largely consist of damages to trees and underbrush in the storm path. At the same time, the long-term ecosystem damages of these storms are uncertain. To be sure, during coastal storms in particular there is often significant erosion of shores and beaches. In the long run, however, nature generally has adapted to these events, so the extent of negative impacts of these events is not clear. Heavy rains that lead to flash floods also can be environmentally damaging, at least locally. They increase soil erosion rates, and if they occur in mountainous areas the resulting flood can create massive damages to ecosystems in narrow mountain valleys. There are currently no estimates of the environmental or ecosystem losses from earthquakes (although the national, long-term impact is probably not great). High winds and waves caused by severe extratropical cyclones damage beaches and shoreline ecosystems. This is a problem mainly along the East Coast when strong ""Nor'easters"" strike along shores ranging from 500 to 1,000 miles in length and in the Great Lakes, where winter storms create waves that severely erode beaches. However, these shoreline effects also can be viewed as an inherent part of nature to which coastal ecosystems have adapted. Although natural disasters are by definition undesirable for humans, they often carry several ecological benefits. Floods are a prime example of the mixed economic and environmental effects. At the other extreme, droughts not only produce economic damage, but virtually all of their environmental impacts are also undesirable. There are only limited quantitative data of the environmental costs of natural disasters. Relatively little effort by the private sector, academics and scientists, or the government has gone into this activity. Nonetheless, such studies as have been conducted reveal that numerous environmental problems caused by natural disasters often have significant consequences for ecosystems, and eventually people, societies, and economies. Thus, even though these environmental impacts may not readily translate into monetized losses (or gains) their importance strongly suggests they should be considered by governments, academia, and the private sector in the study and design of hazard mitigation and land use policies."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the environment through depletion of resources such as quality of air, water and soil; the destruction of ecosystems; habitat destruction; the extinction of wildlife; and pollution. It is defined as any change or disturbance to the environment perceived to be deleterious or undesirable. Environmental concerns can be defined as the negative effects of any human activity on the environment. The biological as well as the physical features of the environment are included. Some of the primary environmental challenges that are causing great worry are air pollution, water pollution, natural environment pollution, rubbish pollution, and so on. Environmental degradation is one of the ten threats officially cautioned by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change of the United Nations. The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction defines environmental degradation as ""the reduction of the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives, and needs"". Environmental degradation comes in many types. When natural habitats are destroyed or natural resources are depleted, the environment is degraded. Efforts to counteract this problem include environmental protection and environmental resources management. Mismanagement that leads to degradation can also lead to environmental conflict where communities organize in opposition to the forces that mismanaged the environment."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Scientists assert that human activity has pushed the earth into a sixth mass extinction event.[4][5] The loss of biodiversity has been attributed in particular to human overpopulation, continued human population growth and overconsumption of natural resources by the world's wealthy. A 2020 report by the World Wildlife Fund found that human activity – specifically overconsumption, population growth and intensive farming – has destroyed 68% of vertebrate wildlife since 1970. The Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, published by the United Nation's IPBES in 2019, posits that roughly one million species of plants and animals face extinction from anthropogenic causes, such as expanding human land use for industrial agriculture and livestock rearing, along with overfishing. Since the establishment of agriculture over 11,000 years ago, humans have altered roughly 70% of the earth's land surface, with the global biomass of vegetation being reduced by half, and terrestrial animal communities seeing a decline in biodiversity greater than 20% on average."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"A 2021 study says that just 3% of the planet's terrestrial surface is ecologically and faunally intact, meaning areas with healthy populations of native animal species and little to no human footprint. Many of these intact ecosystems were in areas inhabited by indigenous peoples.The implications of these losses for human livelihoods and wellbeing have raised serious concerns. With regard to the agriculture sector for example, The State of the World’s Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture, published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2019,[16] states that “countries report that many species that contribute to vital ecosystem services, including pollinators, the natural enemies of pests, soil organisms and wild food species, are in decline as a consequence of the destruction and degradation of habitats, overexploitation, pollution and other threats” and that “key ecosystems that deliver numerous services essential to food and agriculture, including supply of freshwater, protection against hazards and provision of habitat for species such as fish and pollinators, are declining.”"
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"One major component of environmental degradation is the depletion of the resource of fresh water on Earth. Approximately only 2.5% of all of the water on Earth is fresh water, with the rest being salt water. 69% of fresh water is frozen in ice caps located on Antarctica and Greenland, so only 30% of the 2.5% of fresh water is available for consumption. Fresh water is an exceptionally important resource, since life on Earth is ultimately dependent on it. Water transports nutrients, minerals and chemicals within the biosphere to all forms of life, sustains both plants and animals, and moulds the surface of the Earth with transportation and deposition of materials. The current top three uses of fresh water account for 95% of its consumption; approximately 85% is used for irrigation of farmland, golf courses, and parks, 6% is used for domestic purposes such as indoor bathing uses and outdoor garden and lawn use, and 4% is used for industrial purposes such as processing, washing, and cooling in manufacturing centres. "
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"It is estimated that one in three people over the entire globe are already facing water shortages, almost one-fifth of the world population live in areas of physical water scarcity, and almost one quarter of the world's population live in a developing country that lacks the necessary infrastructure to use water from available rivers and aquifers. Water scarcity is an increasing problem due to many foreseen issues in the future including population growth, increased urbanization, higher standards of living, and climate change. Industrial and domestic sewage, pesticides, fertilizers, plankton blooms, silt, oils, chemical residues, radioactive material, and other pollutants are some of the most frequent water pollutants. These have a huge negative impact on the water and can cause degradation in various levels. Climate change affects the Earth's water supply in a large number of ways. It is predicted that the mean global temperature will rise in the coming years due to a number of forces affecting the climate. The amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) will rise, and both of these will influence water resources; evaporation depends strongly on temperature and moisture availability which can ultimately affect the amount of water available to replenish groundwater supplies."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Transpiration from plants can be affected by a rise in atmospheric CO2, which can decrease their use of water, but can also raise their use of water from possible increases of leaf area. Temperature rise can reduce the snow season in the winter and increase the intensity of the melting snow leading to peak runoff of this, affecting soil moisture, flood and drought risks, and storage capacities depending on the area. Warmer winter temperatures cause a decrease in snowpack, which can result in diminished water resources during summer. This is especially important at mid-latitudes and in mountain regions that depend on glacial runoff to replenish their river systems and groundwater supplies, making these areas increasingly vulnerable to water shortages over time; an increase in temperature will initially result in a rapid rise in water melting from glaciers in the summer, followed by a retreat in glaciers and a decrease in the melt and consequently the water supply every year as the size of these glaciers get smaller and smaller."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Thermal expansion of water and increased melting of oceanic glaciers from an increase in temperature gives way to a rise in sea level. This can affect the freshwater supply to coastal areas as well. As river mouths and deltas with higher salinity get pushed further inland, an intrusion of saltwater results in an increase of salinity in reservoirs and aquifers. Sea-level rise may also consequently be caused by a depletion of groundwater, as climate change can affect the hydrologic cycle in a number of ways. Uneven distributions of increased temperatures and increased precipitation around the globe results in water surpluses and deficits, but a global decrease in groundwater suggests a rise in sea level, even after meltwater and thermal expansion were accounted for, which can provide a positive feedback to the problems sea-level rise causes to fresh-water supply. A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth. An increase in water temperature can also affect ecosystems greatly because of a species' sensitivity to temperature, and also by inducing changes in a body of water's self-purification system from decreased amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water due to rises in temperature."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"A rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase in global precipitation but because of increased runoff, floods, increased rates of soil erosion, and mass movement of land, a decline in water quality is probable, because while water will carry more nutrients it will also carry more contaminants. While most of the attention about climate change is directed towards global warming and greenhouse effect, some of the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture. It is generally expected that, on average, global precipitation will increase, with some areas receiving increases and some decreases. Climate models show that while some regions should expect an increase in precipitation, such as in the tropics and higher latitudes, other areas are expected to see a decrease, such as in the subtropics. This will ultimately cause a latitudinal variation in water distribution. The areas receiving more precipitation are also expected to receive this increase during their winter and actually become drier during their summer, creating even more of a variation of precipitation distribution. Naturally, the distribution of precipitation across the planet is very uneven, causing constant variations in water availability in respective locations."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Changes in precipitation affect the timing and magnitude of floods and droughts, shift runoff processes, and alter groundwater recharge rates. Vegetation patterns and growth rates will be directly affected by shifts in precipitation amount and distribution, which will in turn affect agriculture as well as natural ecosystems. Decreased precipitation will deprive areas of water causing water tables to fall and reservoirs of wetlands, rivers, and lakes to empty. In addition, a possible increase in evaporation and evapotranspiration will result, depending on the accompanied rise in temperature. Groundwater reserves will be depleted, and the remaining water has a greater chance of being of poor quality from saline or contaminants on the land surface. Climate change is resulting into a very high rate of land degradation causing enhanced desertification and nutrient deficient soils. The menace of land degradation is increasing by the day and has been characterized as a major global threat. According to Global Assessment of Land Degradation and Improvement (GLADA) a quarter of land area around the globe can now be marked as degraded. Land degradation is supposed to influence lives of 1.5 billion people and 15 billion tons of fertile soil is lost every year due to anthropogenic activities and climate change. "
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Agriculture is dependent on available soil moisture, which is directly affected by climate dynamics, with precipitation being the input in this system and various processes being the output, such as evapotranspiration, surface runoff, drainage, and percolation into groundwater. Changes in climate, especially the changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration predicted by climate models, will directly affect soil moisture, surface runoff, and groundwater recharge. In areas with decreasing precipitation as predicted by the climate models, soil moisture may be substantially reduced. With this in mind, agriculture in most areas already needs irrigation, which depletes fresh water supplies both by the physical use of the water and the degradation agriculture causes to the water. Irrigation increases salt and nutrient content in areas that would not normally be affected, and damages streams and rivers from damming and removal of water. "
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Fertilizer enters both human and livestock waste streams that eventually enter groundwater, while nitrogen, phosphorus, and other chemicals from fertilizer can acidify both soils and water. Certain agricultural demands may increase more than others with an increasingly wealthier global population, and meat is one commodity expected to double global food demand by 2050, which directly affects the global supply of fresh water. Cows need water to drink, more if the temperature is high and humidity is low, and more if the production system the cow is in is extensive, since finding food takes more effort. Water is needed in the processing of the meat, and also in the production of feed for the livestock. Manure can contaminate bodies of freshwater, and slaughterhouses, depending on how well they are managed, contribute waste such as blood, fat, hair, and other bodily contents to supplies of fresh water."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"The transfer of water from agricultural to urban and suburban use raises concerns about agricultural sustainability, rural socioeconomic decline, food security, an increased carbon footprint from imported food, and decreased foreign trade balance. The depletion of fresh water, as applied to more specific and populated areas, increases fresh water scarcity among the population and also makes populations susceptible to economic, social, and political conflict in a number of ways; rising sea levels forces migration from coastal areas to other areas farther inland, pushing populations closer together breaching borders and other geographical patterns, and agricultural surpluses and deficits from the availability of water induce trade problems and economies of certain areas. Climate change is an important cause of involuntary migration and forced displacement According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, global greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture exceeds that of transportation."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Water management is the process of planning, developing, and managing water resources across all water applications, in terms of both quantity and quality."" Water management is supported and guided by institutions, infrastructure, incentives, and information systems The issue of the depletion of fresh water has stimulated increased efforts in water management. While water management systems are often flexible, adaptation to new hydrologic conditions may be very costly. Preventative approaches are necessary to avoid high costs of inefficiency and the need for rehabilitation of water supplies, and innovations to decrease overall demand may be important in planning water sustainability. Environmental Damage means soil erosion, removal of vegetation, destruction of wildlife, pollution of groundwater or surface water, land contamination, air pollution, noise pollution, xxxx fire, disruption to water supplies to natural drainage or natural flow of rivers or streams, damage to archaeological, palaeontological and cultural sites and shall include any damage or injury to, or destruction of, soil or water in their physical aspects together with vegetation associated therewith, aquatic or terrestrial mammals, fish, avi-fauna or any plant or animal life whether in the sea or in any other water or on, in or under land."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Water supply systems, as they exist now, were based on the assumptions of the current climate, and built to accommodate existing river flows and flood frequencies. Reservoirs are operated based on past hydrologic records, and irrigation systems on historical temperature, water availability, and crop water requirements; these may not be a reliable guide to the future. Re-examining engineering designs, operations, optimizations, and planning, as well as re-evaluating legal, technical, and economic approaches to manage water resources are very important for the future of water management in response to water degradation. Another approach is water privatization; despite its economic and cultural effects, service quality and overall quality of the water can be more easily controlled and distributed. Rationality and sustainability is appropriate, and requires limits to overexploitation and pollution and efforts in conservation. Environmental Damage means any actual or alleged Liability (including without limitation Liability for investigatory costs, cleanup costs, governmental response costs, natural resources damages, property damages, personal injuries or penalties) arising out of, based on or relating to (i) the presence, discharge, emission or release into the environment of any Hazardous Substance or (ii) facts or circumstances forming the basis of any violation, or alleged violation, of any Environmental Law."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"Environmental damage is usually defined as damage caused by a sudden incident where an environmentally harmful substance or energy enters or may enter the environment. Environmental damage may occur due to an accident or negligence, but it may also be caused over a longer period of time when an environmentally harmful substance leaks slowly into the environment. Environmental damage may affect e.g. the soil, air, natural environment, surface waters and groundwater, and it may pose a risk to human health. The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the preparation, coordination and implementation of matters concerning environmental risks and for preventing environmental risks from the perspective of environmental protection. Oil and chemical spills are typical types of environmental damage. They comprise vessel oil and chemical spills in maritime and coastal areas and inland waters and oil and chemical spills on land. The Ministry of the Environment guides, monitors and develops post-oil spill cleanup and recovery operations and the prevention of chemical spills and post-spill operations for these within its sphere of activities. If necessary, the municipalities are responsible for cleanup and recovery operations in their territories, assisted by different municipal authorities and institutes."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"The responsibility for combating environmental damage on open see rests with the Border Guard, and in coastal areas and inland waters and on land with the rescue departments. The Finnish Environment Institute and Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment provide experts assistance to combating damage led by the Border Guard and rescue departments, and to post-spill cleanup and recovery operations led by the municipalities. The Ministry of the Environment is preparing a legislative project concerning post-spill cleanup and recovery operations for oil and chemical spills and the organisation of waste management. The project is based on the obligation to move the provisions concerning the post-spill operations from the Rescue Act to a relevant act in the administrative branch of the Ministry of the Environment. The aim is to specify and clarify the legislation on post-spill operations and its application to oil and chemical spills. The project is implemented in close cooperation with the Department for Rescue Services of the Ministry of the Interior, Border Guard and other relevant stakeholders. The government proposal is to be submitted to Parliament in September 2023."

The section entered into force on 1 January 2019. The State supervisory authority may on its own initiative undertake measures to prevent or restrict environmental pollution that are not rescue operations referred to in section 32 of the Rescue Act. The condition for this is that an activity involving a risk of environmental pollution causes or may cause serious danger or harm to health or the environment, and the party responsible for the activity cannot be established without delay or the party concerned is actually incapable to act to the extent that the regular administrative enforcement procedure under section 175 of the Environmental Protection Act cannot be applied. The costs arising from such measures will be collected from the party responsible for the activity. The aim is to ensure that, in the event of a serious environmental accident, unclear responsibilities or insolvency will not be an obstacle to taking the necessary measures to prevent and restrict pollution."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"The purpose of the secondary liability systems for environmental damage is to prepare for the management of environmental risks, compensating for environmental damage, and taking restoration measures in cases where the responsible party is insolvent, unknown or unavailable. The secondary liability systems applied in Finland are the environmental damage insurance, which is mandatory to certain operators, and the Oil Pollution Compensation Fund. Central government budget funds have been used as the last resort. The secondary liability systems also include the support system with a maximum amount of funding allocated in the State budget that is intended, in particular, for analysing the level of contamination and for cleanup of old contaminated sites. The municipalities also provide funding for soil and groundwater restoration in old contaminated sites. The Ministry of the Environment has launched a legislative project to develop the secondary liability systems. The aim for the new system is that the operators would manage their environmental obligations as far as possible without financial intervention by the State. The government proposal for amending the secondary liability systems is to be submitted to Parliament in 2022."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"The Environmental Liability Directive (2004/35/EC) lays down provisions on preventing and remedying significant environmental damage. In the Directive environmental damage means damage to protected species, natural habitats and water and land that has significant adverse effects. The threshold for significance with respect to each type of damage has been set very high. According to the Directive, e.g. land contamination is significant if it creates a risk to human health. The Environmental Liability Directive has been implemented in Finland by several statutes. The competent authority is determined in accordance with the act applicable in each specific case. This means that the competent authority may be the Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment, Regional State Administrative Agency or Board for Gene Technology. In spring 2021, the Commission issued Notice Guidelines concerning the concept of environmental damage in the Environmental Liability Directive. Humans impact the physical environment in many ways: overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water."
ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE,"For environmental damage to occur as a result of an industrial accident, there must be a pathway linking potential releases at the industrial site and sensitive receptors in the environment. The pathway is usually a gravitational liquid flow, the harmful release being in the liquid phase and the receptor being an aquatic ecosystem. With a very few notable exceptions, such as the eponymous Seveso incident, environmental impact from accidental (as distinct from chronic) airborne releases tends to be minor and transient. Dilution of the pollutant cloud via atmospheric dispersion is rapid and any surface deposition is removed effectively by mechanisms such as rain, adsorption onto soil particles and microbial action in the soil. In contrast, liquid releases can flow off site with little or no dilution. On the other hand, should they become massively diluted (most often through the use of firefighting water and foam in an emergency) they will be more mobile, more difficult to contain on site and more likely to reach natural watercourses. Aquatic ecosystems can be very fragile, with many aquatic species susceptible to low concentrations of chemicals dissolved in or transported by water; further, harm to one species can affect many others. Such an ecosystem can take a long time to recover, and may, in fact, never fully recover without human intervention (assuming that is feasible), especially if sediment is affected. "
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Disasters can lead to short-term and long-term effects on physical and mental health, and can indirectly affect health and wellbeing as a result of evacuation, social disruption, financial loss, lifestyle change, damage to health-care facilities, and changes to the wider political and socioeconomic context. Disasters are an important public health issue; however, there is scarce evidence to date on what happens when communities and populations experience more than one disaster. This scoping review identifies literature on the effects of multiple disasters published until Aug 2, 2021, 1425 articles were identified, of which 150 articles were included. We analysed direct and indirect public health implications of multiple disasters. Our analysis suggests that exposure to multiple disasters can affect mental health, physical health, and wellbeing, with some evidence that the potential risks of multiple disaster exposure exceed those of single disaster exposure. We also identified indirect public health implications of multiple disaster exposure, related to changes in health-care facilities, changes in public risk perception, and governmental responses to multiple disasters. We present findings on community recovery and methodological challenges to the study of multiple disasters, and directions for future research. Disasters can lead to short-term and long-term effects on physical and mental health, and can indirectly affect health and wellbeing as a result of evacuation, social disruption, financial loss, lifestyle change, damage to health-care facilities, and changes to the wider political and socioeconomic context. Historically, disasters have been considered as rare, singular, discrete events. However, in the past 10 years, there has been increasing recognition of the ways in which disasters can overlap. In March, 2011, the northeast region of Japan experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake, which led to a tsunami and subsequently to a nuclear disaster—an event that is often referred to as the 3.11 triple disaster. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey resulted in a chemical plant explosion in Texas, USA, in addition to flooding and fires."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"There are many examples of multiple disaster events occurring together, and the past year highlights overlaps between the COVID-19 pandemic and other types of disaster globally. In the context of projected increases in disasters as a result of climate change, and already high frequencies of exposure to overlapping disasters, there is a need to understand the ways in which multiple disasters can affect population health, wellbeing, and recovery processes, and the extent to which these effects might differ from those of single disasters. In the past 5 years there has been a growing body of theoretical and conceptual work to understand so-called cascading disasters (disasters generating secondary disasters), compound disasters (combinations of simultaneous or successive extreme hazard events), and recurrent disasters (in which the same hazard repeats, table). However, unclear and inconsistent terminology is often used to describe multidisaster scenarios, and wider understanding of the public health effects of these events is poor. The literature on cascading or compound disasters is often primarily focused on modelling risks and hazards and on the role of critical infrastructure,5 whereas empirical research, especially on community-level or population-level effects and on long-term recovery processes, has been scarce. The extent of the literature on the public health implications of multiple disasters has been unclear. In this scoping review we aim to identify empirical research on the public health effects of the exposure of individuals or communities to multiple disasters, and recovery from these events. We draw on the definition from the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction of a disaster as a “serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society at any scale due to hazardous events interacting with conditions of exposure, vulnerability and capacity, leading to one or more of the following: human, material, economic and environmental losses and impacts.”"
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"When examining the public health implications of multiple disasters, we take an inclusive view as to what qualifies as a disaster. We build from work in disaster studies identifying the importance of accounting for not only the commonly recognised ‘natural’ and technological disasters, but also slow-onset disasters such as drought,18 chronic disasters,19 and neglected disasters that have received less attention because they are misunderstood or they do not fit into the clear categories of ‘natural’ or technological.20 We approach this Review with recognition that all these disasters have the potential to co-occur, occur sequentially, or repeat, and we seek to identify existing literature on cases in which people or communities have experienced more than one disaster. The focus of this Review is on public health effects and the recovery process from past events, while recognising that exposure to multiple disasters can involve overlapping periods of preparedness, response, and recovery. Through this scoping review we examined the extent, range, and nature of research activity21 on multiple disasters, public health, and recovery. We sought to include any empirical public health literature on previous cases of cascading, compound, or recurring disasters; however, considering the inconsistencies in terminology noted in previous papers, we also left scope to include multiple disaster scenarios that have been researched but not labelled in these ways. Our research questions, therefore, focus on multiple disasters rather than specifying disasters as cascading, compound, consecutive, or recurring. With a focus on identifying and collating learnings from past events, we constrained the focus of this Review to empirical studies from contexts in which people or communities had been previously exposed to more than one disaster. Specific inclusion terms are presented below. We followed the scoping review methodology outlined by Arksey and O'Malley,21 and the principles for reporting in the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The following research questions were developed through preliminary literature searches and discussions with colleagues: what research has been done to examine the complexities of the public health effects of multiple disasters, and what research has been done to examine experiences of recovery from multiple disasters?"
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"There were different approaches to study multiple disasters and mental health. Some studies compared the mental health risks from multiple (more than one) disaster exposures with the risks from a single disaster exposure, and found that multiple exposures were associated with increased risks to mental health (a cumulative effect).For example, in a nationally representative survey of Australians, those exposed to multiple disasters across their lifetime were at significantly greater risk of suicide attempts than were those exposed to a single disaster. Although some researchers have questioned whether exposure to one disaster could have a positive effect of preparing people mentally for future disasters, we identified evidence against this notion. For example, Harville and colleagues46 found that exposure to both Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Gustav was associated with poor mental health, and that even when individuals perceived benefit after the first disaster, this benefit was not protective against the mental health effects of experiencing both disasters. Conversely, one study after the 9/11 terrorism attack (2001) and Hurricane Sandy (2012) found that previous high exposure to the 9/11 terrorism attack was associated with a weaker effect of Hurricane Sandy on post-traumatic stress disorder for older adults, but the opposite result was found for younger adults. These findings represent an area in need of further study; however, from the articles identified in this Review, there were no consistent findings to suggest that experiencing one disaster could be protective against the effects of the next. A group of studies found that mental health outcomes differed according to the severity of multiple disaster exposures (defined by one or more of degree of losses, damage, difficulties in accessing resources, perceived danger, or injuries experienced). Another subset of articles focused on the mental health of children who had experienced multiple disasters found both cumulative effects and differences according to the severity of exposures. Another group of studies found that post-traumatic stress disorder from previous disasters can be exacerbated or reactivated after experiencing the next disaster, even if it is a different type of disaster. This occurrence was highlighted by studies that looked at populations exposed to both the 9/11 terrorism attacks and Hurricane Sandy in New York."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"25 studies focused on factors influencing wellbeing and resilience in settings of multiple disasters, including religiosity and the role of religion on coping, social support,45 the will to live, gender, perceived collective efficacy and perceived communal coping, with mixed findings across different disaster contexts. One subset of articles focused on identifying patterns in positive emotions and post-traumatic growth following multiple disasters, with some studies highlighting that hope and optimism or psychological resilience can be protective factors for mental health after multiple disasters or can facilitate coping and resilience after multiple disasters. More widely, wellbeing and resilience have generally been insufficiently studied following multiple disasters. One systematic review that focused on the 3.11 triple disaster in Japan found numerous studies documenting mental health effects, although little research on the resilience of this population or on possible interventions to support wellbeing. Turning to barriers to wellbeing or resilience in settings of multiple disasters, one study found profound difficulties in balancing home and work responsibilities among workers in the Florida Department of Health who had to respond to four hurricanes in 2004, and who were, in many cases, affected by the hurricanes personally as well as professionally. Cherry and colleagues31 documented threats to cultural heritage, financial challenges, and lingering health concerns as major challenges faced by fishing communities in the Gulf Coast of the USA who were affected by Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Two studies after the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes in New Zealand found inequalities in trajectories of wellbeing and quality of life in the years following the earthquakes by income, ethnicity, and disability and physical health status.118,  121 Conceptualisations of resilience in multiple disaster contexts were also critiqued, with one study finding that people in poor neighbourhoods of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, faced constantly recurring disasters and used resilience strategies as a necessity."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Most experts agree that the frequency and cost of natural disasters are on the rise worldwide. In 2018 alone, the U.S. experienced 14 disaster events costing at least $1 billion each, including wildfires, winter storms, and drought.1 As climate change warms the planet, natural disasters will likely continue to strike with increasing severity and frequency. While the immediate public health impacts of natural disasters are obvious, these events also spark a number of other longer-term problems. Here’s a closer look at some of those impacts.In the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, injuries are the first impacts that must be addressed. Community health workers may need to set up temporary triage areas to treat the wounded, depending on how severely local infrastructure has been affected. Earthquakes tend to result in the highest number of injuries, compared to other events such as tsunamis, floods, storms, or wildfires. While some natural disasters have a high rate of injuries, most result in power outages and infrastructure damage that lead to trouble for patients suffering from chronic diseases. Those living with diabetes, kidney disease, lung disease, or other conditions requiring constant care will often be the first to suffer if healthcare services are interrupted. When a natural disaster destroys infrastructure such as roads, water pipes, and gas lines, additional potential health impacts emerge. Contaminated water and the lack of a functioning sewer system can result in the spread of disease. Sustained power outages can cause food shortages, lost medicine, and the inability to run healthcare facilities safely. One short-term consequence of natural disasters that can stretch into a long-term problem is the issue of food shortages. While the disaster itself might have interrupted supply logistics in the area, damage to farms and factories could also spark longer-lasting food shortages. This can lead to an increase in food prices, putting a financial burden on disadvantaged populations who may not be able to afford basic groceries."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"The trauma of experiencing a natural disaster can cause widespread mental health problems. Immediate mental impacts include shock and grief, but as victims suffer the loss of homes, businesses, and loved ones, they often face longer-term problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. In the long term, natural disasters may also drive an increase in alcohol and drug abuse. Anything from an extended power outage to physical damage at hospitals and other healthcare facilities can lead to a public health crisis for some citizens. Medicines are lost, equipment is damaged or destroyed, and hospital facilities are unable to treat patients adequately. Many people might also flee the area following a disaster, leaving healthcare facilities short-staffed. And with fewer residents, sometimes there is less impetus to rebuild broken healthcare infrastructure. 16 articles focused on physical health after multiple disasters. One study, which looked at 500 communities across the USA, found that those who had experienced recurring disasters had increased incidences of asthma, high blood pressure, and self-reported poor mental health and poor physical health. Moreover, the incidence of all such outcomes increased with each additional year in which a community experienced a disaster.128 After Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf Coast of the USA, one study (focused primarily on mental health) found that people exposed to both of these disasters had more physical health symptoms than did populations exposed to only one of the disasters,41 suggesting a cumulative effect. These studies highlight that exposure to multiple disasters can be associated with poorer self-rated health or increased physical health symptoms than exposure to one disaster. Conversely, not all studies suggested a cumulative effect of multiple disaster exposures on physical health. One article on maternal and child health found that exposure to Hurricane Charley (2004) during pregnancy or shortly before conception was associated with increased risk of extremely preterm delivery; however, exposure to additional hurricanes did not seem to increase this risk further."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"There were also indications of a connection between mental health and physical health outcomes in settings affected by multiple disasters. One study in the Gulf Coast of the USA suggested that losses as a result of Hurricane Katrina were associated with subsequent distress related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which in turn was associated with physical health symptoms—suggesting that mental health effects from disasters can be one pathway to physical health effects. Hayashi and colleagues similarly found that post-traumatic stress disorder and insomnia after the triple disaster in Japan was associated with increased fracture risk among older adults. Several studies in this same context also found a substantial increase in diabetes,129 bodyweight, body-mass index, waist circumference, and polycythemia among populations exposed to the  disasters, with studies finding that those forced to evacuate were at greater risk of these outcomes than were non-evacuees.Other studies found an effect of emotional repression on immune parameters in populations affected by multiple disasters, potential effects of multiple disaster exposures on child growth, and patterns of waterborne and foodborne diseases after meteorological disasters. Four articles focused on mortality after multiple disasters, including issues with death recording and physical and social determinants of mortality. Four articles focused on health-care facilities in settings of multiple disasters. Three studies found staff shortages in the aftermath of the triple disaster in Japan, which persisted for up to 18 months after the disaster and affected local health-care facilities. One study looked at Hurricane Stan (2005) and a subsequent landslide in Guatemala and documented the immediate effects on one hospital, finding major structural damage but also a rapid recovery driven by a common vision shared by workers.134 Across all identified cases, the affected hospitals continued functioning despite major logistical difficulties. Further research on indirect effects on patient care or on the health and wellbeing of hospital staff in multidisaster settings is warranted."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"ight studies focused on public perceptions of risk and related behaviours in settings of recurring disasters, with mixed findings. Smith and McCarty found that, during the four hurricanes in Florida, USA in 2004, hurricane strength was the primary predictor of evacuation behaviours during each hurricane. however, increases in the numbers of hurricanes experienced had no effect on the likelihood of evacuating. Similarly, one study of large earthquakes in Sichuan province (China) found that the severity of past disaster experiences was strongly correlated with perceptions of disaster risk, but the number of past disaster experiences was not. Wang and colleagues59 looked at public complacency (defined as the public believing that the threat would not happen and ignoring it, or not preparing for it, even if the threat appeared imminent) during the 2004 hurricanes in Florida, and found that public complacency peaked after three hurricanes. Other studies across different settings have similarly suggested a need for further work to improve communication and knowledge exchange between residents and government actors in settings affected by recurring disasters, with one study underscoring that multiple disasters could provide a window of opportunity for agencies to engage citizens in preparedness.65 Other studies have identified additional factors that might influence risk perception, evacuation decisions, or both in settings of recurring disasters, including gender, the extent of losses in previous disasters, and persuasion by family and friends. There is a need for further research on how experiencing multiple disasters can influence risk perception and public responses to risk, and the indirect implications there might be for public health as a result (ie, from non-evacuation or delayed evacuation). However, we found an emerging body of literature on the inequitable effects of multiple disaster exposures on physical health, mental health, and recovery processes at the community level. Hahn and colleagues found that communities in the USA that had medium or high ratings on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (built from data on poverty levels, employment, educational attainment, and more) had the highest incidences of self-reported poor mental health, poor physical health, asthma, and high blood pressure after exposure to multiple disasters. Morgan and colleagues found uneven trajectories of wellbeing and quality-of-life scores in the aftermath of the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes in New Zealand. "
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Five articles focused on strategies for coping with multiple disasters at the household and community level. Bacon and colleagues reviewed cumulative disasters in Nicaragua (coffee leaf rust from 2011 to present, drought in 2009, and Hurricane Mitch in 1998) and found a correlation between the coping responses that households used in past events and their continued use in subsequent disasters. Conversely, one study in Nebraska, USA documented various coping mechanisms for handling recurring severe drought in 2002–04 and 2012–14, and found that previous experience with the earlier drought resulted in different actions, including new water-conservation and land-use practices, in the later drought, with support from the government. Two studies examined the role of traditional knowledge systems of recurring disasters. Ngwese and colleagues studied communities affected by recurrent flooding and droughts in Ghana, and found that communities used traditional knowledge systems to prepare for disasters, while often viewing these practices as having low efficacy. In a study of climate-related hazards in Cambodia, Pauli and colleagues142 found that combining traditional knowledge and biophysical data could lead to a better understanding of so-called pressure points, at which the effects of recurring flooding become most severe, and the authors advocate for the co-production of knowledge between scientists and local communities. Our Review suggests that multiple disasters can have direct and indirect effects on physical health, mental health, and wellbeing, with evidence of cumulative effects. Moreover, multiple disasters can affect health-care facilities, population risk perception and evacuation decisions, household and community responses, government responses, humanitarian and non-governmental organisation responses, and recovery processes, in ways that go beyond what is seen from single disasters. A group of studies following the 2015 Nepal earthquakes emphasised inequalities in long-term recovery trajectories, finding that marginalised groups were more likely to face long-term displacement164 and to be excluded from community-led reconstruction initiatives.165 Still further research, policy, and recovery services will need to address inequities when advancing efforts to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from multiple disasters."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Humanitarian emergencies, including natural and human-made disasters, conflicts and complex emergencies, constitute what has traditionally been considered the main threat to health security worldwide. Each year millions of people are affected by natural and man-made disasters around the world. Tornados, hurricanes, heavy rains and earthquakes resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and many more affected. Indeed, disasters would not be disastrous if it were not for their effect on the human population. Links between the natural environment and human health have been suggested for centuries. Disasters throughout history have had significant impact on the numbers, health status and life style of populations. It induce: Deaths, Severe injuries, requiring extensive treatments, Increased risk of communicable diseases, Damage to the health facilities, Damage to the water systems, Food shortage, Population movements. The authors focused on the natural disasters, caused by natural forces rather than by acts associated with human behavior and that affect a large population in a widespread geographic region. Describing the general effects of disasters on health, it does not pretend to cover every contingency. Review of recent literature on humanitarian emergencies has shown that the public health consequences of natural disasters are complex. Disasters directly impact the health of the population resulting in physical trauma, acute disease and emotional trauma. In addition, disasters may increase the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic disease and infectious disease through the impact on the health care system."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Media depictions of natural disaster preparedness tend to highlight immediate needs, such as clothing, food, shelter, and access to medical care. Long after the glaring lights of the news media have turned to another natural disaster, however, survivors of the previous disaster may continue to face health issues. First responders must prepare not only for the immediate effects of natural disasters, but also for the long-term health consequences. Here are the most common lingering effects of natural disasters. Natural disasters can upend a person’s entire existence in a few short hours. Between 15-75 percent of people who experience a natural disaster later develop PTSD. Natural disasters can also worsen existing mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Mental health conditions increase the risk of suicide, addiction, and other health woes. They may also complicate existing physical health conditions."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"First responders must be prepared to respond to mental health emergencies. It’s also critically important to be sensitive to the needs of people with mental health conditions. Emergencies can be triggering for those with PTSD, and mental health conditions can make certain medical procedures frightening or traumatic. A gentle demeanor, a hefty dose of compassion, and a deep understanding of mental health can make treating those with mental illnesses much easier. Infections increase both in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters and over the long term. Following Hurricane Katrina, 25 percent of deaths were due to injuries and trauma. Untreated injuries increase the risk of infection, and these infections can prove fatal if left untreated. They may also lead to lasting disabilities. Following a natural disaster, lack of infrastructure can increase exposure to dangerous microbes. Contaminated water is a key culprit in gastrointestinal infections. Lack of medical care may also mean that fewer people are immunized, increasing the risk of outbreaks."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Chronic medical conditions tend to get worse following a natural disaster. This can be attributed to any of several factors, including: Lack of access to medication. Decreased access to medical care and support services. The effects of chronic stress on the body. Lifestyle changes. For example, diabetes tends to get worse following a natural disaster, due in part to lack of access to healthy food. Following Hurricane Katrina, 14 percent of emergency healthcare visits were for the management of pre-existing chronic conditions. Most people who died during Hurricane Katrina were over the age of 74, pointing to the role of failing health and chronic conditions, and 11% of the deaths were due to heart conditions. First responders must partner with local poison control centers to educate residents about the perils of poisoning. Be prepared to promptly respond to poisoning episodes with emergency medical care, including appropriate airway management."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Poisoning rates increase following a natural disaster, and sometimes for years thereafter. This can further compound existing health problems or increase the risk of new ones. One study found that poisoning increased 10-year mortality even among those who survived the initial poisoning episode. Natural disasters increase the risk of poisoning by contributing to numerous problems, including: Increased exposure to pollution and environmental toxins. Dirty, contaminated water. Medication errors and interactions. Carbon monoxide poisoning, due in large part to generators and grills near the home. Drug abuse and misuse. Mental health issues in the wake of a natural disaster may lead to suicide attempts, or to misuse and abuse of prescription and nonprescription drugs. Infrastructure Loss. Perhaps the most devastating long-term health consequence of natural disasters is the loss of infrastructure. Roads may be damaged. Bridges and homes can collapse. Hospitals may lose power for extended periods or see entire wings destroyed by fire, flood, or wind. This creates a ripple effect, compromising access to healthcare, increasing the risk of injuries from car accidents and falls, and eroding healthcare quality. It can take years, or even decades, to repair infrastructure. When equipment fails and infrastructure is lacking, airway emergencies become more pressing. The right portable emergency suction device helps you maintain a patent airway without a power source."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"The complex and multifaceted nature of health risks secondary to natural disasters will require innovative, holistic, and problem-oriented approaches to risk and disaster management. The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005–2015 (HFA), the goal of which is to strengthen the resilience of nations and communities to natural disasters, is the inspiration for much of the current knowledge, practice, implementation, experience, and the science for natural disaster risk reduction. Natural disaster risk reduction offers a comprehensive framework where stakeholders can take coherent and complementary actions through political, social, technological, economic, and humanitarian processes to build resilience. The aim of the recent Hyogo initiative is to globally increase resilience and reduce vulnerability. This chapter will describe the current state of knowledge of the health consequences of natural disasters, the implications of these consequences for policy, and conclude with recommendations for action."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"There is growing evidence that older adults exposed to natural disasters are at disproportionate risk for adverse health events such as all-cause mortality, injury, hospital admissions, stroke, displacement, cardiopulmonary distress, stress-related mental health problems, and exacerbation of chronic illnesses. Typically, analyses of the health consequences of natural disasters focus only on the populations impacted for the duration and immediate aftermath of the disaster. With few exceptions, the long-term effects of natural disasters on older adult health have not been examined. This article describes the potential consequences of exposure to natural disasters that contribute to cancer and disruption of cancer care treatment systems for older adults. It is argued that exposures to floods and wildfires in particular present an underestimated threat to the onset and/or progression of cancer and cancer care management in older adults. We propose that these impacts should be examined not only from an emergency preparedness perspective during the event but also from a public health focus that prospectively assesses risks for cancer and other health disparities. Recommendations for comprehensive longitudinal risk assessment and emergency preparedness models that address the full impact of natural disasters on the health and well-being of vulnerable, at risk, older adults are offered."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Research pertaining to natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires has evolved over the past several decades. However, it was not until the 1980s that research began reporting findings for older adults (Bolin & Klenow, 1982, 1988). Studies on the health hazards of natural disasters tend to focus on one specific type of disaster (e.g., wildfires) or the consequences from a specific event (e.g., flooding following Hurricane Harvey). With few exceptions, the long-term health effects of natural disasters are seldom examined. Only recently (following Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy) has there been evidence documenting the disproportional risk for adverse health consequences among older adults during and immediately after natural disasters (Adams, Kaufman, van Hattum & Moody, 2011; Fitzgerald, 2010; Henderson, Roberto, & Kamo, 2010; Malik et al., 2018; USGCRP, 2017). Literature is beginning to report on the longitudinal impact of natural disasters on chronic illnesses such as diabetes and mental health among older adults (Cherry et al., 2012; Fonseca et al., 2009; Wilson-Genderson, Heid, & Pruchno, 2018). However, there remains a paucity of research on the long-term impact of natural disasters on cancer risk among older adults and on cancer care treatment systems."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Findings from scientific reviews of climate change have concluded that the increase in global greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere have contributed to an increase in extreme weather contributing to the conditions necessary for the development of natural disasters and other adverse events (IPCC, 2012; Parry, Canziani, Palutiikof, Van der Linden, & Hanson, 2007; USGCRP, 2017). Although there is considerable variation in the patterns of natural disasters in the United States from year to year, there is unequivocal evidence that the frequency, intensity, and severity of natural disasters are increasing including wildfires (Cansler & McKenzie, 2014), tropical cyclones/hurricanes in the Atlantic region (Landsea, Vecchi, Bengtsson, & Knutson, 2010), droughts (Cook, Smerdon, Seager, & Cook, 2014), and heat waves in cities (Habeeb, Vargo, & Stone, 2015) and in the Southeast (Smith, Zaitchik, & Gohlke, 2013). Other indicators of the escalating threat of natural disasters are the increasing amounts of devastation, displacement of populations, financial impact, and morbidity and mortality among victims. For example, in 2016, the number of recorded natural disasters in the United States included severe thunderstorms (43), flash floods (19), wildfires (18), winter storms and cold waves (7), tropical cyclones (2), and earthquakes (2) resulting in insured losses of $23.8 billion and 262 fatalities."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Current trends of increased severity, duration, intensity, and repeated exposure to natural disasters in the United States suggest that the threat to the general population and especially disadvantaged and older populations will continue to increase. Examples include the frequency and intensity of wildfires and repeated flooding episodes along coastal areas. The threat of wildfires, especially in the western United States, is contributing to an expanding forest fire season. As a result of increasing average temperatures globally, the annual mean number of forest fire burns in the western United States is expected to increase by 54% in next 20–25 years (Spracklen et al., 2009). The recent Northern California wildfires such as the Carr Fire and the coastal flood surges following Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina are particularly noteworthy “hot spots” in terms of areas with high risk due to the probability of multiple occurrences of natural disasters in these geographic areas (Diffenbaugh, Giorgi, & Pal, 2008; Sherbinin, 2014). There is considerable evidence that older adults are at disproportionally high risk of death, injury, and disability as a result of natural disasters (Filberto, Wells, Wethington, Pillemer, & Wysocki, 2009). Examples of disproportionate vulnerability among older adults include Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy and the 2017–2018 Thomas wildfire in California."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"On the basis of spatial analyses of natural disaster occurrences over time, the escalation of threat from natural disasters is magnified given that many of these “hot spot” regions have stable populations of older adults who are likely to experience multiple reoccurring natural disasters during their lifetimes (Borden & Cutter, 2008; Habeeb et al., 2015). These findings suggest that the risk of adverse events resulting from natural disasters will continue to escalate in terms of extending intensity, duration, and frequency of exposure among those residing in these areas and will continue to be a growing national public health concern (Cherry et al., 2012; Fonseca et al., 2009; LaJoie, Sprang & McKinney, 2010). Given the escalating frequency of natural disasters and the growth of older adult populations residing in “hot spot” areas, the health risk to older adults is significant and is likely to increase (Lau, Scandrett, Jarzebowski, Holman, & Emanuel, 2007). Over 70% of those who died during Hurricane Katrina were older than 60 years of age and a similar profile was reported for Hurricane Sandy where almost half of those who died were 65 or older (Parry, 2013). Similarly, of the 44 deaths resulting from the wildfires in northern California, a disproportionate percent of the victims were older adults (Liu, Pereira, Uhl, Bravo, & Bell, 2016)."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"The link between natural disasters and cancer among older adults has received minimal attention. However, the cancer risk consequences of exposure and potential for reexposure to natural disasters should be considered. Specifically, the health impacts of wildfires and flood-storm surges may present cancer risks, particularly to older adults. The risk factors for cancer differ between these two types of disasters. In the case of wildfires, cancer risk results from the chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) in the air. The soot and smoke of wildfires contain high levels of ash and particulate matter (PM2.5) that remains suspended in the air. The specific health concern is the harmful airborne PM associated with forest fires. These smaller airborne particles, specifically PM2.5, have been found to embed and accumulate in the lungs resulting in respiratory disease (Liu et al., 2015). Although there is insufficient evidence on the health effects of PM from wildfires among older adults, exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mortality (Pun, Kazemiparkouhi, Manjourides, & Suh, 2017). There is also evidence that the amount and duration of exposure are contributing factors. A meta-analysis of 17 articles examining the association between exposure to PM2.5 and lung cancer showed a significant association (Huang, Pan, Wu, Chen, & Chen, 2017). Although subgroup analyses were conducted, age differences were not examined. In addition, attributing PM2.5 from forest fires to cancer is confounded with long-term exposure to PM2.5 from ambient air pollution. However, exposure to PM2.5 has been associated with mortality among older adults (Wang et al., 2017). "
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"In the case of flooding resulting from storm surge, toxins, and carcinogens in the flood waters may present a threat for cancer. For example, 13 of 34 federal Superfund sites reported leakage of toxins including highly toxic dioxin contamination resulting from flooding due to Hurricane Harvey. For months after Harvey, residents in the region continued to be exposed to toxins from contaminated standing water and sediment (Shultz & Galea, 2017). The potential causes of cancer are complex, given the wide range of toxins, waste products, and pollutants present in the wastewater and the variability in residents’ exposure length, time, and proximity to toxic sites. However, individuals who were exposed to the flood waters were likely exposed to multiple chemicals (Friedrich, 2017). Likewise, post-disaster conditions may potentially increase the risk of infectious disease transmission including Hepatitis B, which is known to cause liver cancer (CDC, 2018).Increases in the duration of wildfires in the western region of the United States and continued exposure even after containment of wildfires suggest that populations are experiencing longer exposures to the harmful PM2.5 particulates associated with cancer. In particular, older adults with chronic obstructed pulmonary disease are at heightened vulnerability."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"The longer-term health consequences of exposure to carcinogens associated with PM2.5 from wildfires or toxins found in floodwaters suggest that increased risk for cancer from natural disasters is likely and is even greater for those who may already have cancer. Although the causal linkage of exposure risk resulting from natural disasters to subsequent development of cancer in noncancer afflicted older adults is still being investigated, it has been well established that for those with needs for ongoing cancer care, natural disasters pose significant risk. Preparation for natural disasters appropriately focus on plans for evacuation, shelter for those displaced, search and rescue, health care resources for those harmed during and immediately after the disaster, and providing the basics such as food and water. The immediate focus is on addressing acute health issues such as injuries, infections, and trauma. Mokdad and colleagues (2005) note that although this is necessary, it is also necessary to have disaster preparation for those whose health is already compromised. Although a natural disaster can occur almost anywhere, it is common that the impact of the disaster is greater among disadvantaged populations including the poor, medically underserved, those with limited resources and restricted mobility, and those who may have difficulty evacuating from disasters. A common consequence of natural disasters is that the health care system is overwhelmed with attending to the acute emergency needs of disaster victims."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Assessment of the impact of different types of natural disasters shares similar objectives and procedures including obtaining information about an affected community, assessing the health of residents in the affected community and prioritizing community responses. Although considerable research has focused on the immediate and short-term impacts/health consequences after natural disasters, little research has focused on the longer-term health risks (i.e., toxins in the ground from floods/PM inhalation from wildfires) and accumulation over time due to both repeated exposures and age. Similarly, long-term risk also includes disruptions of the cancer care system and rebuilding these systems is often a long-term problem. A major reason for the lack of longitudinal, longer-term health risk assessment following natural disasters is that the emergency preparedness and response sector and the public health sector operate under different risk assessment models. Generally speaking, the emergency preparedness and response sector focuses on four basic stages of a disaster, which are preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation with a timeline that extends from 6–12 months post-disaster for the mitigation phase."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"This model has been used successfully for decades and has recognized procedures and outcomes that have been well documented. In addition, this model is appropriate for considering each individual natural disaster event where preparation for and response to the isolated adverse event is required. However, this model does not allow for continued assessments after the mitigation period and cannot account for the impacts of multiple exposures over time. From the public health sector, the CDC has incorporated rapid health assessment in their Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) toolkits that are used for health impact assessments and for monitoring changing needs during the aftermath of a disaster (CDC, 2012). CASPER is conducted primarily at the household level and is designed to provide decision makers with information regarding basic needs and health status of a disaster-impacted population to make informed resource needs decisions. CASPER seldom focuses on individual health status and is not intended to collect information on the same individuals over time. Similar to the emergency preparedness and response sector, public health risk assessment is limited to evaluating circumstances in the short term after an adverse event."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Natural disasters, by definition, can present a major threat to health and well-being. Their sudden onset can result in injury and death and impose a substantial burden on local healthcare capacities (de Goyet et al., 2006). According to Limaye et al. (2019), ten climate-related disasters in the U.S. in 2012 caused 917 deaths, 20,568 hospital admissions, and 17,857 emergency department visits. Further, the health risks associated with natural disasters are expected to grow due to an increase in frequency and severity because of climate change (Ji and Lee, 2021). With the growing concern about health risks due to natural disasters, promoting resilience is pivotal for disaster risk management (de Goyet et al., 2006; Sandifer and Walker, 2018). Defined as “the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events” (NRC, 2012, p.1), resilience to natural-hazard health risks derives from individual capacities “to sustain (oneself) physically, mentally, and socially” in the aftermath of large-scale disruptions. Following exposure to a natural disaster, resilient individuals will show a desirable outcome, such as the absence of medical or psychiatric disorders (Bonanno, 2012) and quick adjustments in symptoms (Norris et al., 2009). While the aftermath of a natural disaster may, by destroying property and disrupting normal functioning, reveal significant loss in resources, evacuation and relocation to overcrowded facilities (Greenough et al., 2008) can increase the risk of psychological distress and disease outbreaks (Aitsi-Selmi et al., 2016). "
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Being resilient also depends on how individuals recover from distress and maintain healthy functioning (Bonanno, 2012). COR posits that the loss or threatened loss of resources can lead to different coping behaviors intended to mitigate the adverse impact of a disaster (Freedy et al., 1992; Hobfoll et al., 2011; Hobfoll and Schumm, 2009). Individuals can engage in proactive coping by focusing on altering or solving problems that result from their resource loss or perceived threat of loss (Freedy et al., 1992). Those who develop health issues may adopt active healthcare routines to secure early diagnoses or manage symptoms to recover and even improve their health. Adopting healthy behaviors can also contribute to improved overall health and thus mitigate the health risk of future disasters (Lindell, 2013). Although problem solving-focused coping involves persistent motivation to deal with challenging circumstances (Freedy et al., 1992) and require substantial resource investment (Hobfoll et al., 2011), they usually lead to better outcomes such as improved health over the long term. People can also use defensive coping to deny the threat or to disengage, mentally and behaviorally, from a stressful situation (Freedy et al., 1992; Hobfoll et al., 2011). For example, by diminishing a person's capacity (Freedy et al., 1992) to access healthcare or use medication and rehabilitation services (Hobfoll et al., 2011), an economic loss can adversely affect their health (Aitsi-Selmi et al., 2016). Loss aversion can also lead to a reluctance to use preexisting resources against future threats."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"Generally, people are more resilient to natural hazards if they do not suffer from post-traumatic pathological and psychopathological conditions. They tend to use problem solving-focused behaviors rather than disengagement strategies. COR emphasizes that a key factor for promoting post-disaster resilient trajectories lies in personal and local resources and a willingness to invest in them, that is, the extent to which individuals pursue resilient trajectories in the aftermath of a natural disaster depends on whether they can draw on their own and community resources. Resilience resources are the “predispositions or characteristics at the individual, social, or community level” that may moderate the adverse impact of natural disasters. They include psychosocial resources (i.e., optimism, social networks), socioeconomic resources (i.e., wealth, social status), and other characteristics (i.e., genetic and behavioral traits) and vary among individuals and communities. In the aftermath of a disaster, two resources are particularly salient for pursuing healthy functioning: socio-economic status (SES) at the individual-level and healthcare capacity at the community-level. Public health therefore views disasters in terms of what the health care providers do to the human populations within the confines of preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters and emergencies. Many Governments and organiszations in the world have made attempts to ameliorate the suffering of humans who have been affected by disasters. This paper discusses the implications of disasters on public health and the health care system within the fundamental principles that guide the practice of public health during disasters."
HEALTH_IMPACTS,"To cope in disasters, SES is particularly useful for engaging in problem solving-focused behaviors. Those with a higher SES (i.e., better personal resources) have a greater willingness and capacity to invest in and orchestrate those resources, which are needed to manage stress and optimal health. However, adopting better healthcare routines and behaviors is contingent on affordability and knowledge about coping behaviors. Rather than investing in their health, those in a lower SES might focus on preserving their limited resources and thus have less motivation to invest in healthcare. They may pursue disengagement coping behaviors, relying on less costly ways to reduce stress, such as alcohol or drug abuse, over the short term. Socio-economic status (SES), such as employment, income, education, and race/ethnicity, accounts for why some individuals show more resilient trajectories than others after a disaster. Disasters are the tragedies of a natural or human-made hazard which poses a level of threat to life, health, property, or that negatively affects society or environment. The sources of disasters could be natural or human generated. Among the natural disasters affecting our environment include earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood tsunami, landslide, hurricanes/tropical cyclones/typhoons, lightening among others. Again, the human induced disasters plaguing the society include the following – terrorism, bombing, riots, protests, clashes, gas leakage and flaring. The impacts of disasters are numerous and devastating on both the health of the human populations and the vital infrastructure. "
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity, and health professionals worldwide are already responding to the health harms caused by this unfolding crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that to avert catastrophic health impacts and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths, the world must limit temperature rise to 1.5°C. Past emissions have already made a certain level of global temperature rise and other changes to the climate inevitable. Global heating of even 1.5°C is not considered safe, however, every additional tenth of a degree of warming will take a serious toll on people’s lives and health. While no one is safe from these risks, the people whose health is being harmed first and worst by the climate crisis are the people who contribute least to its causes, and who are least able to protect themselves and their families against it - people in low-income and disadvantaged countries and communities. The climate crisis threatens to undo the last fifty years of progress in development, global health, and poverty reduction, and to further widen existing health inequalities between and within populations. It severely jeopardizes the realization of universal health coverage (UHC) in various ways – including by compounding the existing burden of disease and by exacerbating existing barriers to accessing health services, often at the times when they are most needed. Over 930 million people - around 12% of the world’s population - spend at least 10% of their household budget to pay for health care. With the poorest people largely uninsured, health shocks and stresses already currently push around 100 million people into poverty every  year, with the impacts of climate change worsening this trend. Climate change affects the social and environmental determinants of health – clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Building on the analyses of 2020, 2021 and 2022 Human Development Reports - and fed by an evolving stream of frontier research - the data shows how climate change can impact people’s lives – from mortality to livelihoods, and energy use. Although higher temperatures and a warmer climate put cardiovascular and respiratory systems under stress everywhere, outcomes will vary between places, according to communities that have the resources to adapt and those that do not. The data shows that climate change could increase mortality rates in Faisalabad, Pakistan by near 67 deaths per 100,000 population – causing more fatalities than strokes, the country’s third leading cause of death. In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, however, higher incomes could keep the death toll to 35 per 100,000, which is still deadlier than Alzheimer’s disease – the sixth leading cause of death globally. Since the late 19th century, the earth’s average temperature has risen by nearly 1.2°C, changing the entire surface area of the planet, according to the research. However, billions live in regions that have already experienced warming greater than the global average. As an example, the platform pointed to Maracaibo, Venezuela, noting that in the 1990s it averaged 62 annual days with temperatures exceeding 35°C. However, by mid-century, that number will likely soar to 201 days. Electricity availability and fuels used to generate it to power air conditioners and heaters, play a crucial role in our ability to cope with extreme temperatures, said UNDP. Yet, the impacts of climate change on energy use will vary locally, as individuals, communities and businesses adapt to conditions using available resources. In Jakarta, for example, electricity consumption in response to warmer temperatures is projected to increase by roughly one-third of current household consumption in Indonesia. This will require critical additional infrastructure planning. As the impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed globally, they will generate a significant uptick in inequalities over the coming years and decades. But by highlighting that the future is not predetermined, UNDP hopes the information can empower people everywhere, to step up climate action. The Human Climate Horizons mission is to ensure equal access to data on future impacts, inform decision-making and help everyone understand the human consequences of climate change in different scenarios."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"A disaster related to a weather, climate or water hazard occurred every day on average over the past 50 years – killing 115 people and causing US$ 202 million in losses daily, according to a comprehensive new report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The number of disasters has increased by a factor of five over the 50-year period, driven by climate change, more extreme weather and improved reporting. But, thanks to improved early warnings and disaster management, the number of deaths decreased almost three-fold. According to the WMO Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (1970 – 2019), there were more than 11 000 reported disasters attributed to these hazards globally, with just over 2 million deaths and US$ 3.64 trillion in losses. The report is the most comprehensive review of mortality and economic losses from weather, water and climate extremes to date. It assesses the entire 50-year period as well as by individual decade. From 1970 to 2019, weather, climate and water hazards accounted for 50% of all disasters, 45% of all reported deaths and 74% of all reported economic losses. More than 91% of these deaths occurred in developing countries (using the United Nations Country Classification). Of the top 10 disasters, the hazards that led to the largest human losses during the period have been droughts (650 000 deaths), storms (577 232 deaths), floods (58 700 deaths) and extreme temperature (55 736 deaths). Deaths decreased almost threefold from 1970 to 2019. Death tolls fell from over 50 000 deaths in the 1970s to less than 20 000 in the 2010s. The 1970s and 1980s reported an average of 170 related deaths per day. In the 1990s, that average fell by one third to 90 related deaths per day, then continued to fall in the 2010s to 40 related deaths per day. WMO is strengthening collaboration with its partners to address risks associated with weather, climate and water extremes. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, which moves into WMO headquarters in Geneva on 1 September, and the World Health Organization contributed to the WMO Atlas. More lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due tåo population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events.  More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. The overlap of the COVID-19 pandemic with many other natural and manmade hazards, especially extreme weather events during the last 18 months demonstrates the need for greater investment in disaster risk reduction and a multi-hazard approach to disaster risk management and early warning systems to reduce risks and strengthen preparedness for multiple disaster scenarios."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"In most years, the death toll from disasters is now in the range of 10,000 to 20,000 people. In the most fatal years – which tend to be those with major earthquakes or cyclones – this can reach tens to hundreds of thousands. This trend does not mean that disasters have become less frequent, for less intense. With almost minute-by-minute updates on what’s happening in the world, we are constantly reminded of the latest disaster. These stories are, of course, important but they do not give us a sense of how the toll of disasters has changed over time. For most of us, it is hard to know whether any given year was a particularly deadly one in the context of previous years. To understand the devastating toll of disasters today, and in the past, we have built a Natural Disasters Data Explorer which provides estimates of fatalities, displacement and economic damage for every country since 1900. This is based on data sourced from EM-DAT, a project that undertakes the important work of building these incredibly detailed histories of disasters. In this visualization I give a sense of how the global picture has evolved over the last century. It shows the estimated annual death toll – from all disasters at the top, followed by a breakdown by type. The size of the bubble represents the total death toll for that year. I’ve labeled most of the years with the largest death tolls. This usually provokes the follow-up question: “Why? What event happened?”. So I’ve also noted large-scale events that contributed to the majority – but not necessarily all – of the deaths in that year.  For example, the estimated global death toll from storms in 2008 was approximately 141,000. 138,366 of these deaths occurred in Cyclone Margis, which struck Myanmar, and is labeled on the chart. What we see is that in the 20th century, it was common to have years where the death toll was in the millions. This was usually the result of major droughts or floods. Often these would lead to famines. Improved food security, resilience to other disasters, and better national and international responses mean that the world has not experienced death tolls of this scale in many decades. Famines today are usually driven by civil war and political unrest. In most years, the death toll from disasters is now in the range of 10,000 to 20,000 people. In the most fatal years – which tend to be those with major earthquakes or cyclones – this can reach tens to hundreds of thousands. This trend does not mean that disasters have become less frequent, for less intense. It means the world today is much better at preventing deaths from disasters than in the past. This will become increasingly important in our response and adaptation to climate change."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Tens of thousands of small-scale disasters occur each year throughout the world because of flooding, landslides, fires and storms. These events are not reported in international databases. Yet, their impact can be just as damaging as large disasters, causing death, injury and loss of livelihoods. An analysis of records in 104 countries found that between 2005 and 2017, small and medium, localized and frequent disasters caused 68% of all economic losses. These losses are a major driver of poverty as they tend to be absorbed by low-income households and communities, small businesses, and local and national governments. Similarly, losses from slow-onset hazards such as droughts are not always fully accounted for. Their effect often accumulates slowly over an extended period and their impacts are difficult to measure. When slow-onset disasters are added to the Asia-Pacific region’s riskscape, annualized economic losses more than quadruple to USD $675 billion or around 2.4 percent of the region’s GDP (compared to previous estimates). Direct losses refer to the physical or structural impact caused by the disaster such as the destruction of infrastructure resulting from high winds, flooding or ground shaking. 14.9 million excess deaths were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Excess mortality includes deaths associated with COVID-19 directly (due to the disease) or indirectly (due to the pandemic’s impact on health systems and society). Yet, these reported losses only represent the tip of the iceberg. Natural disasters kill on average 45,000 people per year, globally. Globally, disasters were responsible for 0.1% of deaths over the past decade. This was highly variable, ranging from 0.01% to 0.4%. What natural disaster killed the most people? The 1556 Shaanxi earthquake. An estimated 830,000 people died as their yaodong — cave homes carved into the region's loess plateaus — collapsed. The exact magnitude of the quake is lost to history, but modern-day geophysicists estimate it at around magnitude 8. We surveyed 2,000 people from across the country, asking, “What's the Scariest Natural Disaster?” The scariest disaster with 34% of the vote were tornadoes. Earthquakes were next on the list of America's fears with 24% of the vote, followed by hurricanes (19%), flooding (11%), mudslides (9%), and lightning (3%)."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Every year, some of the deadliest natural disasters — earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, wildfires and droughts, on average kill nearly 60,000 people, according to Global Change Data Lab(opens in new tab).  Violent natural disasters have been a fact of human life since the beginning of mankind, but the death counts of the most ancient of these disasters are lost to history. The ancient Mediterranean island of Thera (now Santorini, Greece), for example, experienced a catastrophic volcanic eruption that eradicated the entire Minoan civilization around 1600 B.C., according to a 2020 study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences(opens in new tab). But exactly how many lives were lost? We'll never know. However, thanks to historical records and journals, historians can at least estimate the number of fatalities linked to disasters that occured in the common era. According to such records, the following natural disasters are the deadliest of all time, ranked from lowest to highest estimated death toll. (For those disasters for which a death toll range is given, the disaster is ranked by the highest end of the estimate.) The number of deaths from natural disasters can be highly variable from year-to-year; some years pass with very few deaths before a large disaster event claims many lives. If we look at the average over the past decade, approximately 45,000 people globally died from natural disasters each year. This represents around 0.1% of global deaths. What we see is that in many years, the number of deaths can be very low – often less than 10,000, and accounting for as low as 0.01% of total deaths. But we also see the devastating impact of shock events: the 1983-85 famine and drought in Ethiopia; the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami; Cyclone Nargis which struck Myanmar in 2008; and the 2010 Port-au-Prince earthquake in Haiti. All of these events pushed global disasters deaths over 200,000 – more than 0.4% of deaths in these years. Low-frequency, high-impact events such as earthquakes and tsunamis are not preventable, but such high losses of human life are. We know from historical data that the world has seen a significant reduction in disaster deaths through earlier prediction, more resilient infrastructure, emergency preparedness, and response systems. Those at low incomes are often the most vulnerable to disaster events: improving living standards, infrastructure and response systems in these regions will be key to preventing deaths from natural disasters in the coming decades."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"On Oct. 11, 1138, the ground under the Syrian city of Aleppo began to shake. The city sits on the confluence of the Arabian and African plates, making it prone to temblors, but this one was particularly violent. The magnitude of the quake is lost to time, but contemporary chroniclers reported that the city's citadel collapsed and houses crumbled across Aleppo. The resulting death toll is estimated at around 230,000, but that figure comes from the 15th century, and the historian who reported it may have conflated the Aleppo quake with one that occurred in what is now the modern-day Eurasian country of Georgia, according to a 2004 paper in the journal Annals of Geophysics(opens in new tab). Still, this supposed death toll ties this event as the 10th most deadly natural disaster of all time. Tied for 10th place is a catastrophic magnitude 9.1 earthquake that struck undersea off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, on Dec. 26, 2004. The quake created a massive tsunami that killed approximately 230,000, and displaced nearly 2 million people in 14 South Asian and East African countries. Traveling as fast as 500 mph (804 kph), the tsunami reached land in as little as 15 to 20 minutes after the quake hit, giving residents little time to flee to higher ground. In some places, especially hardest-hit Indonesia, the tsunami wave reached over 100 feet (30 meters) high, according to World Vision(opens in new tab), a humanitarian aid organization. Damages from the earthquake and tsunami are estimated at $10 billion dollars. This event is considered the third largest earthquake in the world since 1900, and its tsunami has killed more people than any other tsunami in recorded history, according to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. At 3:42 a.m. on July 28, 1976, the Chinese city of Tangshan was razed to the ground by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)(opens in new tab). Tangshan, an industrial city with a population of about 1 million at the time of the disaster, suffered staggering casualties of over 240,000. While this was the official death toll, some experts suggest this number is grossly underestimated and that the loss of life was likely closer to 700,000. Reportedly, 85% of Tangshan's buildings collapsed, and trembles were felt in Beijing, China, more than 100 miles (180 km) away. It took several years before the city of Tangshan was rebuilt to its prior glory."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"As with all disasters occurring millenia ago, a precise death toll for the Antioch earthquake is hard to come by. Contemporary chronicler John Malalas wrote at the time that about 250,000 people died when the temblor hit the Byzantine Empire city (now Turkey and Syria) in May, 526. Malalas attributed the disaster to the wrath of God and reported that fires destroyed everything in Antioch that the earthquake did not. According to a 2007 paper in The Medieval History Journal(opens in new tab), the death toll was higher than it would have been at other times of the year because the city was full of tourists celebrating Ascension Day — the Christian feast that commemorates Jesus' ascension into heaven. ""The Haiyuan earthquake was the largest quake recorded in China in the 20th century with the highest magnitude and intensity,"" Deng Qidong, a geologist with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said during a seminar(opens in new tab) in 2010. The earthquake, which struck north central China's Haiyuan County on Dec. 16, 1920, also rocked the neighboring Gansu and Shaanxi Provinces. It was reportedly a 7.8 on the Richter scale, however, China today claims it was of magnitude 8.5. There are also discrepancies in the number of lives lost. The USGS(opens in new tab) reported total casualties of 200,000, but according to a 2010 study(opens in new tab) by Chinese seismologists, the death toll could have been as high as 273,400. The region's high deposits of loess soils (porous, silty sediment that's very unstable) triggered massive landslides which were responsible for over 30,000 of these deaths, according to a 2020 study published in the journal Landslides. The Coringa cyclone made landfall at the port city of Coringa on India's Bay of Bengal on Nov. 25, 1839, whipping up a storm surge of 40 feet (12 m), according to NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory Hurricane Research Division(opens in new tab). The hurricane's wind speeds and category are not known, as is the case for many storms that took place before the 20th century. About 20,000 ships and vessels were destroyed, along with the lives of an estimated 300,000 people. Tying the Coringa cyclone as the sixth deadliest natural disaster is the 1881 typhoon that hit the port city of Haiphong in northeastern Vietnam on October 8. This storm is also believed to have killed an estimated 300,000 people. "
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"The catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti just northwest of Port-au-Prince on Jan. 12, 2010, ranks as one of the three deadliest quakes of all time. Haiti's standing as one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere and its limited history of large earthquakes left it extremely vulnerable to damages and loss of life. As many as 3 million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates were all over the place; initially, the government of Haiti estimated fatalities stood at 230,000 people, but in January 2011, officials revised that figure to 316,000. A 2010 study published in the journal Medicine, Conflict and Survival(opens in new tab) put the number at around 160,000 deaths, while the USGS claimed even lower numbers — around 100,000. These disparities reflect the difficulty of counting deaths even in the modern era, not to mention the political wrangling that goes on over ""official"" numbers.This tropical cyclone hit what is now Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) on Nov. 12-13, 1970. According to NOAA's Hurricane Research Division(opens in new tab), the storm's strongest wind speeds measured 130 mph (205 kph), making it the equivalent of a Category 4 major hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane scale. Ahead of its landfall, a 35-foot (10.6 m) storm surge washed over the low-lying islands bordering the Bay of Bengal, causing widespread flooding. The storm surge, combined with a lack of evacuation, resulted in a massive death toll estimated at 300,000 to 500,000 people. A 1971 report from the National Hurricane Center and the Pakistan Meteorological Department acknowledged the challenge of accurately estimating the death toll, especially due to the influx of seasonal workers who were in the area for the rice harvest. As of the writing of this article, the Bhola cyclone is considered the deadliest tropical cyclone on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization(opens in new tab). And it caused an estimated $86 billion in damages. Globally, over the past decade, natural disasters accounted for an average of 0.1% of total deaths.

An estimated 830,000 people died as their yaodong — cave homes carved into the region's loess plateaus — collapsed. The exact magnitude of the quake is lost to history, but modern-day geophysicists estimate it at around magnitude 8. The Yellow River (Huang He) in China was precariously situated far above most of the land around it in the late 1880s, thanks to a series of dikes built to contain the river as it flowed through the farmland of central China. Over time, these dikes had silted up, gradually lifting the river in elevation. When heavy rains swelled the river in September 1887, it spilled over these dikes into the surrounding low-lying land, inundating 5,000 square miles (12,949 square km), according to ""Encyclopedia of Disasters: Environmental Catastrophes and Human Tragedies"" . As a result of this flood, an estimated 900,000 to 2 million people lost their lives. Excessive rainfall over central China in July and August of 1931 triggered the most deadly natural disaster in world history — the Central China floods of 1931. The Yangtze River overtopped its banks as spring snowmelt mingled with the over 24 inches (600 millimeters) of rain that fell during the month of July alone. (The Yellow River and other large waterways also reached high levels.) According to ""The Nature of Disaster in China: The 1931 Yangzi River Flood(opens in new tab)"" , the flood inundated almost 70,000 square miles (180,000 square km) and turned the Yangtze into what looked like a giant lake or ocean. Contemporary government numbers put the number of dead at around 2 million, but other agencies, including NOAA, say it may have been as many as 3.7 million people. As we see, over the course of the 20th century there was a significant decline in global deaths from natural disasters. In the early 1900s, the annual average was often in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the second half of the century and into the early 2000s, we have seen a significant decline to less than 100,000 – at least five times lower than these peaks. This decline is even more impressive when we consider the rate of population growth over this period. When we correct for population – showing this data in terms of death rates (measured per 100,000 people) – then we see a more than 10-fold decline over the past century. "
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Loss of Life means death, including clinical death determined by the local governing medical authorities. Natural disasters negatively affected many countries this year, causing thousands of deaths and financial losses. While some countries struggled with extreme heat, others were inundated by severe floods. A total of 232 people died as a result of floods caused by heavy rains in Brazil, while at least 1,000 lost their lives in the 5.9 magnitude earthquake that struck Afghanistan's eastern province of Paktika. In Pakistan, 1,739 people died and 13,000 people were injured in the floods caused by monsoon rains in about five months. Six people are killed due to the eruption of an underwater volcano and the ensuing tsunami that hit the Pacific island nation of Tonga. The volcanic eruption triggers tsunami warnings in Japan and Australia, while Peru closes 80 ports as waves tower and declares an ""environmental emergency"" days later due to pollution caused by oil spills on 21 beaches. More than 100,000 people are stranded without electricity due to a heavy snowstorm that hit the central and northeastern states on the US Atlantic coast. In Ecuador, 23 people lose their lives and 47 are injured in floods caused by heavy rains. Over 4,000 flights are canceled due to a snowstorm in the central US as 100,000 people face power outages.

LOSS_OF_LIFE,"A natural disaster is a sudden event that always causes widespread destruction, major collateral damage or loss of life, brought about by forces other than the acts of human beings. A natural disaster might be caused by earthquakes, flooding, volcanic eruption, landslide, hurricanes etc. To be classified as a disaster, it will have profound environmental effect and/or human loss and frequently causes financial loss. This list takes into account only the highest estimated death toll for each disaster, and lists them accordingly. It does not include epidemics and famines. It does not include several volcanic eruptions with uncertain death tolls resulting from collateral effects such as crop failures; see List of volcanic eruptions by death toll. The list also does not include the 1938 Yellow River flood, which was caused by the deliberate destruction of dikes. Just seven feet above sea level, Galveston was steamrolled by an ocean surge nobody saw coming, taking 10,000 lives — about one quarter of its population at the time. The tragedy of 122 years ago was repeated, to an extent, several times in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Just one year before Galveston’s disaster, extreme wind and rain associated with a Puerto Rico hurricane killed about 3,400 people. In 1893, a pair of storms with enormous surges killed 1,000 to 2,000 people, one in Georgia and the other in Louisiana. A 1928 hurricane killed more than 1,800 in Florida, its deadliest storm to date, when a devastating surge spread from Lake Okeechobee into surrounding areas."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Deaths associated with hurricanes have generally declined since that era because of improved predictions and warning systems. But storms such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and now Ian — probably Florida’s deadliest since 1935 — show that our coasts remain perilously vulnerable. Statistics from the National Hurricane Center show that the overwhelming majority of the deadliest U.S. hurricanes in history occurred before 1960, even as more people move to the Gulf and Atlantic coastlines every year. When the 1928 hurricane struck Florida, for example, it had a population of around 1.5 million. Today, more than 21 million people live there. Walker Ashley, a professor at Northern Illinois University who researches weather and natural disasters, wrote in an email that the monitoring, detection and forecasting of storms is a “scientific revolution that has saved countless lives.” Ashley also credited stronger building codes and evacuation coordination between federal and local authorities for keeping people out of harm’s way. Still, numerous 21st-century hurricanes have caused dozens of deaths. A short list of storms — Ike, Sandy, Katrina, Maria and now probably Ian — have killed more than 100 people each. Drowning due to storm surge caused the majority of the fatalities in these storms, although most of the nearly 3,000 deaths in Maria were related to power outages induced by wind."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"What causes the greatest loss of life in a hurricane. Storm surge and large waves produced by hurricanes pose the greatest threat to life and property along the coast. Storm Surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm's winds. Storm surge can reach heights well over 20 feet and can span hundreds of miles of coastline.- Water is the No. 1 killer during a hurricane or tropical storm that strikes the U.S. – comprising nearly 90% of all tropical cyclone deaths – mostly by drowning in either storm surge, rainfall flooding or high surf, according to a 2014 study by Dr. Edward Rappaport, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center. Stock non-perishable emergency supplies and prepare a Disaster Supply Kit. Use a NOAA weather radio. Have fresh and spare batteries. Take First Aid, CPR and disaster preparedness classes from the Red Cross. Ground vibrations during an earthquake are seldom the direct cause of death or injury. Most earthquake-related injuries and deaths result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects caused by the ground shaking. The most deadly earthquake in history was in Shaanxi, China in 1556. It's estimated to have killed 830,000 people. This is more than twice that of the second most fatal: the recent Port-au-Prince earthquake in Haiti in 2010. It's reported that 316,000 people died as a result."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"There is more damage and more deaths from earthquakes in other parts of the world primarily because of buildings which are poorly designed and constructed for earthquake regions, and population density. Volcanoes spew hot, dangerous gases, ash, lava, and rock that are powerfully destructive. People have died from volcanic blasts. Volcanic eruptions can result in additional threats to health, such as floods, mudslides, power outages, drinking water contamination, and wildfires. Can earthquakes cause extinction. Today, both natural and human induced factors are cause of extinction. Natural causes for extinction include the following: asteroids, acid rain, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, climatic heating or cooling, changes in sea level or currents, cosmic radiation, predation and disease, and spread of invasive species. This report presents data about natural disasters impacts (human and economic) at world scale for the last 20 years. The analyses focus on trends and patterns of impacts and how these vary regarding the income level or the geographical location. Based on the analyses, conclusions and action points were drawn to raise the awareness and frame the debate for the next steps that need to be done in disaster risk reduction. The report is based on EM-DAT data from the period between 1994 and 2013, which includes 6,873 natural disasters worldwide, which claimed 1.35 million lives or almost 68,000 lives on average each year, and affected 218 million people on average per annum during this 20-year period."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"The review brings a number of conclusions on the human cost of disaster. One of the findings is that population growth and patterns of economic development are more important than climate change or cyclical variations in weather when explaining the upward trend. Today, not only are more people in harm’s way than there were 50 years ago, but building in flood plains, earthquakes zones and other high-risk areas has increased the likelihood that a routine natural hazard will become a major catastrophe. EM-DAT data also show that flooding caused the majority of disasters between 1994 and 2013, accounting for 43% of all recorded events and affecting nearly 2.5 billion people, and that storms were the second most frequent type of disaster, killing more than 244,000 people and costing US$936 billion in recorded damage. Earthquakes (including tsunamis) killed more people than all other types of disaster put together, claiming nearly 750,000 lives between 1994 and 2013. Tsunamis were the most deadly sub-type of earthquake, with an average of 79 deaths for every 1,000 people affected, compared to four deaths per 1,000 for ground movements. This makes tsunamis almost twenty times more deadly than ground movements."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Drought affected more than one billion people between 1994 and 2013, or 25% of the global total. This is despite the fact that droughts accounted for just 5% of disaster events in this period. Some 41% of drought disasters were in Africa, indicating that lower-income countries are still being overwhelmed by drought despite effective early warnings being in place. In absolute numbers, the USA and China recorded the most disasters between 1994 and 2013, due mainly to their size, varied landmasses and high population densities. Among the continents, Asia bore the brunt of disasters, with 3.3 billion people affected in China and India alone. If data are standardized, however, to reflect the numbers of people affected per 100,000 head of population, then Eritrea and Mongolia were the worst-affected countries in the world. Haiti suffered the largest number of people killed both in absolute terms and relative to the size of its population due to the terrible toll of the 2010 earthquake."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"While disasters have become more frequent during the past 20 years, the average number of people affected has fallen from one in 23 in 1994-2003 to one in 39 during 2004-2013. This is partly explained by population growth, but the numbers affected have also declined in absolute terms. Death rates, on the other hand, increased over the same period, reaching an average of more than 99,700 deaths per year between 2004 and 2013. This partly reflects the huge loss of life in three megadisasters (the 2004 Asian tsunami, Cyclone Nargis in 2008 and the 2010 Haitian earthquake). However, the trend remains upward even when these three events are excluded from the statistics. Analysis of EM-DAT data also shows how income levels impact on disaster death tolls. On average, more than three times as many people died per disaster in low-income countries (332 deaths) than in high-income nations (105 deaths). A similar pattern is evident when low- and lower-middle-income countries are grouped together and compared to high- and upper-middle-income countries. Taken together, higher-income countries experienced 56% of disasters but lost 32% of lives, while lower-income countries experienced 44% of disasters but suffered 68% of deaths. This demonstrates that levels of economic development, rather than exposure to hazards per se, are major determinants of mortality."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"GENEVA - UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is deeply saddened to see the tragic aftermath of this morning’s deadly earthquake in Afghanistan. Reports suggest that so far nearly 1,000 people have died and more are injured amid large-scale destruction. UNHCR has deployed staff to the most affected areas in Pakitika and Khost provinces from its field office in Gardez. Currently the focus is on search and rescue operations to find survivors. There are fears that more lives could be lost if survivors are not reached urgently in remote parts of the country. Interim authorities have appealed for immediate humanitarian assistance and UNHCR is rushing supplies and staff to assist the affected people, working with other humanitarian partners. “It is heart-breaking to see this tragedy unfolding in Afghanistan on top of the ongoing humanitarian crisis that Afghans are going through every day,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. “I convey my deepest sympathies to the people of Afghanistan and especially those who have lost friends and family in this horrific natural disaster. UNHCR stands with Afghans at this difficult time and will make all efforts to provide relief to those affected.” Afghanistan is going through a dire humanitarian crisis with some 3.5 million people displaced inside the country. Millions of others are struggling to survive amid rising levels of poverty and hunger, with social services under immense strain."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"“This tragedy highlights once again that Afghans need and deserve the world’s solidarity and support,” Grandi added. UNHCR has worked with Afghans for the last four decades inside Afghanistan and neighbouring countries. Nearly one million displaced Afghans and host communities have been assisted with aid since January this year. Every year, around 60,000 people die worldwide in natural disasters. The majority of the deaths are caused by building collapse in earthquakes, and the great majority occurs in the developing world. This is despite the fact that engineering solutions exist that can almost completely eliminate the risk of such deaths. Why is this? The engineering solutions are both expensive and technically demanding, so that the benefit-cost ratio of such solutions is often unfavorable compared with other interventions designed to save lives in developing countries. Nonetheless, a range of public disaster riskreduction interventions (including construction activities) are highly cost effective. The fact that such interventions often remain unimplemented or ineffectively executed points to a role for issues of political economy. Building regulations in developing countries appear to have limited impact in many cases, perhaps because of limited capacity and the impact of corruption. Public construction is often of low quality—perhaps for similar reasons. This suggests approaches that emphasize simple and limited disaster risk regulation covering only the most at-risk structures and that (preferably) can be monitored by non-experts. It also suggests a range of transparency and oversight mechanisms for public construction projects."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Natural disasters have killed thousands of people in the space of a few minutes. Their after-effects can kill thousands more over subsequent weeks and years. They can have a huge cost in terms of damaged buildings and infrastructure. And yet, many of the deaths and much of the damage is preventable. This paper focuses on where the great majority of the human cost of disasters is concentrated – the developing world. It examines the reasons behind continued, wide-scale death and destruction from disasters, and what these reasons suggest about effective responses in the context of developing countries. Earthquakes kill thousands every year. The 8.0 magnitude Sichuan Earthquake in 2008 killed over 70,000 people. The 6.8 earthquake in Algeria in 2003 killed 2,700, the 1999 Marmara earthquake in Turkey killed 17,000 (Escaleras, Anbarci and Register, 2007, Anbarci, Escaleras and Register, 2005). Earthquakes account for the majority of deaths from a range of natural disasters which amounts to about 60,000 people a year worldwide – around 90 percent of which occur in developing countries (OECD, 2008). Most earthquake deaths are related to building collapse or damage. In the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, for example, hundreds of thousands of buildings – including numerous public buildings such as schools and hospitals – collapsed. Beyond the human toll, the cost of this physical destruction can be considerable. The Marmara earthquake was estimated to have had a direct economic impact of over $5 billion (World Bank, 2005)."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"There is absolutely no overlap between the top twenty most costly insured disasters worldwide 1970-2005 and the top twenty worst catastrophes in terms of lives lost. All of the most costly events in terms of property damage hit wealthy countries (where the density of economic activity is higher), all of the most deadly hit developing countries. In addition, eighteen out of twenty of the most costly were hurricanes, typhoons and storms, eleven out of twenty of the most deadly were earthquakes (from OECD, 2008). Why is this? Earthquake deaths in particular can be prevented by engineering approaches that are widely applied in wealthy countries but rare in the developing world. It is more difficult to comprehensively prevent flood and wind damage using similar approaches. In the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, early evidence suggests that non-ductile and un-reinforced concrete buildings were particularly prone to collapse. This has been a ubiquitous problem in the developing World. Jain (2005) suggests that in 1999-2000 over 6,000 school buildings were constructed in Gujarat, India using seismically weak pre-cast construction technology. "
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Little is known about the effect of drought on all-cause mortality, especially in higher income countries such as the United States. As the frequency and severity of droughts are likely to increase, understanding the connections between drought and mortality becomes increasingly important.Most of the results were null for associations between drought severity and mortality, across joint strata of race, age, sex and region, but incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for 17 subgroups were significant after accounting for the multiple testing, indicating a possible protective effect of drought on mortality for that particular subpopulation. The meta-regression indicated heterogeneity in the association of drought with mortality according to race, climate region, and age, but not by sex. Marginal means of the estimated log-incidence rate ratios differed significantly from zero for age groups 25–34, 35–44, 45–54 and 55–64; for the white race group; and for the South, West and Southwest regions, in the analysis that included wet county-years. The margin of the meta-regression model suggested a slightly negative, but not statistically significant, association of drought with same-year mortality in the overall population."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"There were significant, heterogeneous-direction associations in subpopulation-stratified models, after controlling for multiple comparisons, suggesting that the impacts of drought on mortality may not be monolithic across the United States. Meta-regression identified systematic differences in the associations of drought severity with all-cause mortality according to climate region, race, and age. These findings suggest there may be important contextual differences in the effects of drought severity on mortality, motivating further work focused on local mechanisms. We speculate that some of the estimated negative associations of drought severity with same-year mortality could be consistent with either a protective effect of drought on total mortality in the same year, or with a delayed health effect of drought beyond the same year. Further research is needed to clarify associations of drought with more specific causes of death and with sublethal health outcomes, for specific subpopulations, and considering lagged effects occurring beyond the same year as the drought. Ideally, all mortality estimation would be done using vital statistics and census data. Census data will give detailed information about the population at risk of death. The vital statistics provide information about live births and deaths in the population.[13] Often, either census data and vital statistics data is not available. This is common in developing countries, countries that are in conflict, areas where natural disasters have caused mass displacement, and other areas where there is a humanitarian crisis "
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Drought generally occurs as a result of a water deficit for a given area, but the actual definition of drought differs depending on the measures considered, such as precipitation and temperature. Droughts are commonly divided into four major types based on their environmental and human impacts, including meteorological drought (i.e., abnormally low precipitation), hydrological drought (i.e., precipitation shortages that impact the surface and groundwater levels), agricultural drought (i.e., decreased soil moisture that impacts crops), and socioeconomic drought (i.e., decreased water supply that affects people and supply of goods). Further, droughts can be characterized by additional factors such as duration, intensity, spatial distribution, frequency, and rate of onset. In 2012, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that medium confidence exists that droughts in some areas of the world have increased in duration and intensity since the 1950s and this pattern will likely continue to over the next century, due to decreased precipitation and/or increased evapotranspiration. Droughts can lead to widespread and multifaceted regional impacts. Recent droughts in Kenya, the Mediterranean and California have led to crises including food insecurity, political instability, and severe economic damage, respectively. Numerous studies and articles have researched and constructed pathways that connect drought to health effects."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Mortality rate, or death rate, is a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a particular population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time. Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year; thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 (out of 1,000) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total. It is distinct from ""morbidity"", which is either the prevalence or incidence of a disease, and also from the incidence rate (the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time). An important specific mortality rate measure is the crude death rate, which looks at mortality from all causes in a given time interval for a given population. As of 2020, for instance, the CIA estimates that the crude death rate globally will be 7.7 deaths per 1,000 people in a population per year. The crude death rate is defined as ""the mortality rate from all causes of death for a population,"" calculated as the ""[t]otal number of deaths during a given time interval"" divided by the ""[m]id-interval population"", per 1,000 or 100,000; for instance, the population of the U.S. was around 290,810,000 in 2003, and in that year, approximately 2,419,900 deaths occurred in total, giving a crude death (mortality) rate of 832 deaths per 100,000. As of 2020, the CIA estimates the U.S. crude death rate will be 8.3 per 1,000, while it estimates that the global rate will be 7.7 per 1,000."
LOSS_OF_LIFE,"Mortality rate is also measured per thousand. It is determined by how many people of a certain age die per thousand people. Decrease of mortality rate is one of the reasons for increase of population. Development of medical science and other technologies has resulted in the decrease of mortality rate in all the countries of the world for some decades. In 1990, the mortality rate of children under 5 years of age was 144 per thousand, but in 2015 the child mortality rate was 38 per thousand. In most cases there are few if any ways to obtain exact mortality rates, so epidemiologists use estimation to predict correct mortality rates. Mortality rates are usually difficult to predict due to language barriers, health infrastructure related issues, conflict, and other reasons. Maternal mortality has additional challenges, especially as they pertain to stillbirths, abortions, and multiple births. In some countries, during the 1920s, a stillbirth was defined as ""a birth of at least twenty weeks' gestation in which the child shows no evidence of life after complete birth"". In most countries, however, a stillbirth was defined as ""the birth of a fetus, after 28 weeks of pregnancy, in which pulmonary respiration does not occur"". Orphanhood surveys estimate mortality by questioning children are asked about the mortality of their parents. It has often been criticized as an adult mortality rate that is very biased for several reasons. The adoption effect is one such instance in which orphans often do not realize that they are adopted. Additionally, interviewers may not realize that an adoptive or foster parent is not the child's biological parent. There is also the issue of parents being reported on by multiple children while some adults have no children, thus are not counted in mortality estimates."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"Disasters almost always affect livelihoods and reduce people’s ability to support themselves in the future. In some cases, the disruption to livelihoods can take years to recover from, particularly in areas that experience a greater frequency of recurring disasters. In other instances, livelihood conditions are unlikely to ever return to their previous condition. For those with limited options for alternative livelihoods, the risk of poverty is heightened, and so in turn is their vulnerability to future disasters. Therefore, although disasters can strike anywhere, the poverty-disaster cycle is the most vicious in the most vulnerable regions. How do natural disasters affect livelihood? Disasters almost always affect livelihoods and reduce people's ability to support themselves in the future. In some cases, the disruption to livelihoods can take years to recover from, particularly in areas that experience a greater frequency of recurring disasters. Ecosystems provide services on which poor communities rely disproportionately for their well- being and basic needs. These communities also depend on the environment to earn incomes in sectors such as agriculture, fishing, forestry and tourism, through both formal and informal markets. Climate change affects seasonal livelihood opportunities especially those related to natural resource harvesting like mopane worms and thatch grass harvesting. The thatch grass is now limited because of declining grasslands. Weather and climate to a large degree determine how we stay warm (or cool) enough to survive, how (and if) we stay comfortable, what modes of transportation we use, what type of clothing we wear, what foods we can grow and eat in an area, and what resources (such as water and trees) are plentiful or rare. How does climate change affect livelihood assets? A deviation in the temperature and rainfall requirements of crops indicates impacts such as crop failure, livestock deaths, economic losses, higher food prices, and reduced food security; these influences will eventually increase the world's demand for food. Livelihood refers to the full range of means that individuals, families and communities utilize to make a living, such as wage-based income, agriculture, fishing, foraging, other natural resource-based livelihoods, petty trade and bartering."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"Measuring livelihood resilience is a difficult task, and practical methods to measure livelihood resilience are needed. We use the structural dynamics to describe the changes in livelihood resilience of Sichuan rural residents from quadruple dimensions: livelihood quality, livelihood promotion, livelihood provision and disaster stress. Results show that (i) the livelihood resilience of rural residents is significantly positively correlated with the livelihood quality, livelihood promotion and livelihood provision, but substantially negatively correlated with the disaster stress. The livelihood resilience is dominated by both livelihood provision and livelihood promotion. (ii) the effect of different natural disasters on the livelihood resilience varies. The contribution rates of earthquake, flood and drought to livelihood resilience are −0.5%, −0.3% and −0.1%, respectively. The clear understanding of the vulnerable targets such as the poor, agricultural sector, disaster-prone hilly and mountainous areas in Sichuan Province can help limit a disaster's adverse impact on livelihood; (iii) developing incentives to motivate healthcare professionals to retain in rural areas, increasing the scale operations in the education and health sectors, promoting the equitable access to farmland and the economic viability of local farms have to be important part of livelihood resilience improvement. The concept of resilience has been gaining critical mass in academia since the 1960s (Be'ne´, Wood, Newsham, & Davies, 2012). The resilience idea arose from multiple sources and has been examined from multiple disciplinary perspectives . As different people and disciplines pursue their journey of inquiry about complex systems, understanding of the concept of resilience varies. However, there is a growing consensus that resilience is not static but keeps changing . And the method of resilience quantification is missing. Livelihood resilience is a key component of sustainable livelihoods, primarily reflecting the coping capability to external stresses and shocks, and the ability to return to the original state of livelihood."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"Three major challenges in livelihood resilience assessment are identified in the existing literature: the first one is the quantitative simulation of livelihood resilience. Despite richness in theory and concept, due to a livelihood and resilience have various dimensions at the individual and structural levels (Speranza & Rist, 2014), the operationalization is difficult and multiple dimensions need to be considered when conceptually and empirically integrating livelihood and resilience (Beichler, Hasibovic, Davidse, & Deppisch, 2014; Quandt, 2018; Speranza & Rist, 2014). A review of many case studies demonstrates that assessments of livelihood resilience usually focus on qualitative description, concept framework, index-oriented analysis and questionnaire surveys (Table 1). To date, the quantitative tendency to focus on resilience has left a gap in our understanding of livelihood resilience and makes it difficult to investigate main variables for livelihood resilience across multiple scales. The second is how to mirror the dynamic nature of livelihood resilience, which implies there is an urgent and continuing need for assessing dynamics and trajectories of livelihood resilience. An equally important aspect in assessing livelihood resilience is analyzing the way in which livelihood resilience change over time, and in response to what stimuli (Vaitla et al., 2012). But the application of qualitative description, conceptual framework, questionnaire survey, and index-orientated analysis methods in description of dynamic livelihood resilience proves to be difficult (Ingrisch & Bahn, 2018; Merritt, Patch, Reddy, & Syme, 2016). Thirdly, it is extremely difficult to identify the determinants and structural effect that affect livelihood resilience (Quandt, 2018). This means that any successful assessment for livelihood resilience needs to address the issues of interaction among human-caused and natural factors (Frankenberger & Nelson, 2013). In particular, there is still lack of empirical evidence and understanding of the complex causal relationships between livelihood resilience and natural disasters (Marschke & Berkes, 2006; Prado et al., 2015; Sallu et al., 2010; Speranza & Rist, 2014; Thulstrup, 2015). As is in shown in Table 1, the literature to explore quantitatively the livelihood resilience of rural residents based on natural disasters is very scarce (Ayeb-Karlsson, Geest, Ahmed, Huq, & Warner, 2016; Merritt et al., 2016; Shiferaw et al., 2014). As pointed out by Hoon, Singh, and Wamali (1997), a modeling of livelihood resilience helps to explain how the elements that constitute a livelihood system change over time."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"It is argued that here, due to the dynamicity and complexity of state of livelihood resilience, it is necessary to address the link between livelihood resilience and multi-stresses including natural disasters through quantitative assessment and dynamic simulation. For this purpose, we attempt to establish the numerical model based on structural dynamics from four dimensions of livelihood quality, livelihood promotion, livelihood provision and disaster stress, the model enables us to capture different states of system and tendency of changes in livelihood resilience, identify major driving variables that relate livelihood resilience. The objectives of this paper are threefold: (i) to develop the quantitative model of livelihood resilience based on structural dynamics; (ii) to identify the determinants for livelihood resilience in the context of natural disaster stress; and (iii) to quantify the adverse effect of different natural disasters on livelihood resilience of rural residents. From 1978, the livelihood resilience of rural residents in Sichuan exhibited a great fluctuation, generally showing an increase followed by a decrease. The changes in livelihood resilience also presented a significant periodicity. During 1978–1990, the livelihood resilience of rural residents showed a rapid growth, while during the two decades of 1991–2014, it was substantially reduced. The structural dynamics magnificently describes the dynamic changes of rural residents' livelihood resilience since the reform and opening in Sichuan, which quantitatively explains the structural effect of livelihood quality, livelihood promotion, livelihood provision and disasters stress on livelihood resilience. The variation process follows the reality of Sichuan, so it may be a new insight and way for studying the livelihood resilience."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"In the face of serious disruptions to local livelihoods and asset bases by extreme climatic events, it is paramount to reconstruct but also to transform and diversify livelihoods. However, the literature on these aspects is scant. In this paper, we posit that two frameworks, namely the livelihood strategy approach and community resilience thinking, are useful tools for effectively analyzing post-disaster transformational changes. In the empirical context of coastal communities of Bangladesh, our study specifically examines the changes experienced in livelihood assets due to Cyclones Sidr and Aila. Two coastal communities, namely Nilganj and Dhulasar Unions in the Kalapara Upazila of Patuakhali District, were selected to analyze the strategies used by local people to cope with and adapt to cyclone and storm surge disaster-shocks. Primary data were collected from three sources: a socioeconomic survey of 300 households, eight focus group discussions, and 20 key informant interviews. Our findings reveal that a significant number of cyclone victims were displaced from their homes by recent severe cyclones, changed their occupations -- both intra- and intersectorally -- and confronted increased consumption and social costs. We observed significant differences in impacts between farmers and those engaged in other occupations, such as fishing, with the latter being far more likely to change occupation post-disaster. The study uncovered significant evidence that local people are learning to live with change and uncertainty by nurturing and combining various types of knowledge and social memory, generating diversified livelihood options, and self-organizing to enhance their resilience to future extreme weather events. The present study explores the concepts of ‘livelihood strategies’ [14,15], ‘resilience’ and ‘livelihood adaptation’ in the empirical context of coastal social-ecological systems in Bangladesh."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"Extreme weather events have widely been seen to disrupt people's livelihoods by destroying their houses, assets and other capital, and reducing income and stocks, resulting in enduring poverty and prolonged shocks and stresses. Coastal communities in the developing world are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events, which seriously threaten local livelihoods and asset-bases. Livelihoods are sustainable when people are capable of coping with and recovering from stresses and shocks quickly, i.e., they are resilient to such shocks, such that the natural resource base on which they depend is not undermined. In view of the increased frequency and intensity of nature-triggered disasters (e.g., cyclones and floods) globally, research on post-disaster recovery emphasizes the processes of enhancing victim and community resilience, as well as of their adaptation and livelihood reconstruction strategies. Livelihood strategies depict the patterns and transformation of livelihoods of individuals or groups of people (e.g., households or the wider community). The concept enables an examination of an individual household's strategic actions within the context of social differentiation and the risks associated with livelihoods, and acquiring an insight into people's beliefs, needs, aspirations and challenges in reconstructing their livelihoods. Use of the livelihood strategy approach can therefore help to elucidate the characteristics of different livelihood options, and the process of enhancing livelihood resilience against shocks, stresses, and perturbations (e.g., cyclones). In a real-world context, investigated livelihood strategies that contribute to increase resilience within two different social-ecological dryland contexts in rural Botswana. Further, Marschke and Berkes analyzed the livelihoods of two Cambodian fishing villages, where they identified various livelihood diversification strategies that are commonly used by fishers at the household and community levels for coping, adapting, and building resilience to disaster shocks and stresses. ‘Resilience thinking’ offers a lens through which the dynamics, strategies, and post-disaster reconstruction processes of livelihoods can be examined, and adaptive capacity1 to deal with future changes can be facilitated. In this paper, we employ the concept of resilience to refer to “the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity and feedbacks”. Our use of the concept of adaptability implies the ability to make the necessary adjustments, through internal processes and with external drivers, permitting continued development. Adaptive capacity is intertwined with the core notions of sustainable livelihoods, livelihood reconstruction , and resilience thinking."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"It has been argued that locally-led adaptation to disaster risks, drawing on socio-economic structures and local culture, can enhance the resilience of local communities to stresses and shocks. With such adaptive capacity, resilient communities can sustain themselves even in the face of multi-faceted adverse environmental situations, and can confront threats and risks to livelihood security. In addition, resilient communities succeed in coping with disaster shocks as well as in reorganizing themselves and adapting to changes. Bangladesh is ranked seventh in the Global Climate Risk Index 2020 [33]. Approximately 70–80 tropical cyclonic storms develop annually around the globe, of which 7% originate in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall along the Bangladesh coast. With 60 million people inhabiting Bangladesh's coastal regions living in poverty with a GDP per capita of less than USD $1516, social vulnerability along the coast is also very high. As the frequency of extreme weather events is rapidly increasing due to climate change, it is likely that livelihoods and earning opportunities in the coastal areas will face increased risks in the future. It is therefore critical to examine livelihood strategies, adaptation, and resilience to natural hazards in the coastal communities of Bangladesh, as they are among the most vulnerable to extreme climatic events, such as cyclones and associated tidal surges. Since 2000, Bangladesh's coast has been struck by two severe cyclones,2 namely Cyclones Sidr in 2007 and Aila in 2009. These extreme climatic events were of comparable magnitude to the 1970 and 1991 cyclones, the deadliest and most destructive on record; however, it is notable that Sidr and Aila resulted in considerably fewer human casualties and much less property damage. Local livelihood recovery and rehabilitation processes were also far more robust. These less destructive outcomes are claimed to be due largely to the knowledge and experience gained over the previous 30 years that was effectively converted into improved disaster preparedness and livelihood diversification and adaptation practices. However, despite these improvements, many livelihoods and local assets still remain extremely vulnerable to cyclone hazards."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"There are noticeable knowledge gaps regarding the characteristics of disruptions and changes in livelihood assets and resources caused by cyclone disasters, livelihood strategies taken by communities in post-cyclone reconstruction, how local people built livelihood resilience, and how local communities have adapted to cyclone-related interruptions, shocks, and stresses. In association with these critical research questions, the purpose of this paper is to assess, based on the experiences of Cyclones Sidr and Aila, the livelihood strategies, post-disaster reconstruction processes, and resilience attributes of coastal communities in Bangladesh. The specific objectives are to: (i) examine the changes in coastal livelihood assets caused by severe cyclone disasters; (ii) analyze livelihood strategies in terms of coping and recovery; and (iii) examine the specific attributes of livelihoods resilience and locally-led adaptation to cyclone and storm surge disasters.We assess livelihood reconstruction and resilience building processes considering two conceptual lenses: (i) the sustainable livelihood framework and local livelihood strategy approach, to understand the impacts of disasters on livelihood resources and the recovery process from the loss and damage incurred; and (ii) livelihood resilience and adaptation at the community level, to underscore the link between resilience building as a process and livelihood sustainability in the coastal. We conducted our field investigation during 2014–2015 in two disaster-prone Unions (the lowest-level administrative unit in a four-tier hierarchical system) of Kalapara Upazila (sub-district – the 3rd level administrative unit) of Bangladesh. They are located in the southwest coastal region of the country in the District of Patuakhali, between 21048ʹ and 22005ʹ north latitude and 90005ʹ and 90020ʹ east longitude."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"The sociodemographic characteristics of the sample population are presented in Table 2. The occupational status of the respondents overall revealed that farming had the highest proportion (45%), followed by fishing (25%) and trading/vendor (13%). Occupational categories varied between the selected Unions: in Nilganj Union, farming was the dominant occupation while in Dhulasar the highest proportion of households were engaged in fishing (46%). Most of the sampled households were headed by males. Our research revealed that flexibility in livelihood strategies for recovery, diversification, resilience, and adaptation is the most critical variable in building a disaster resilient coastal community. In recent years, research on coastal community livelihood dynamics, vulnerability, post-disaster reconstruction, and resilience to disasters has increasingly focused on three main areas of inquiry: (i) patterns and factors of change [66,69], (ii) coping and livelihood reconstruction. In coastal communities of Bangladesh, post-cyclone and storm surge recovery priorities require special attention to livelihood trajectories, reconstruction processes, and community resilience to the natural hazards. Recognizing the importance of these issues, the present study examined the changes in coastal livelihood assets and resources due to severe cyclones and storm surges, and analyzed the livelihood strategies of inhabitants in terms of coping, adaptation, and resilience building in two. Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to different natural disasters mainly due to its geo-physical setting and socio-economic conditions. Disasters such as floods, river bank erosion, cyclone, heavy rainfall, water logging, salinity intrusion etc. are gradually intensifying by climate change and composing risks for the coastal people in Bangladesh. The present study is aimed at to explore the impacts of natural disasters on people’s livelihoods of Dehergati union at Babuganj upazila of Barisal district along with to find out the existing adaptation strategies as well. Both primary (household questionnaire survey, focus group discussion, key informants interview) and secondary data (newspapers, journals, books, online articles, web site, and Government office data) were collected accordingly. Results revealed that the intensity, frequency and damaging impact are high for cyclone, river bank erosion and flood in the study area. Findings also stated that that natural disasters have affected the livelihoods of the study area in many folds including scarcity of pure drinking water, malnutrition, extreme poverty, health problems and livelihoods impacts such as losses and damage in crop cultivation, fisheries, poultry, vegetables garden etc. Disasters driven consequences have created a state of unemployment among the community people. To overcome the livelihoods impacts people are adopting both major (i.e.-changes of crop pattern, raising agriculture land, mulching system, crop combination, preservation of seed, raising pond bank etc.) and minor (i.e.- raising homestead plinth, storage of fuel wood and dry food, making handicrafts etc.) livelihood adaptation strategies."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"Livelihood resilience is defined as the capacity of all people across generations to sustain and improve their livelihood opportunities and well-being despite environmental, economic, social and political disturbances. Livelihood resilience has become a popular research and policy concept in the context of climate change. In this paper, we employ the structural dynamics method to describe livelihood resilience of Sichuan rural residents based on four components of livelihood quality, livelihood promotion, livelihood provision, and natural disasters pressure. Results indicate that: (i) The livelihood resilience of rural residents was significantly positively correlated with livelihood quality, livelihood promotion and livelihood provision, but there was a strong negative correlation with the natural disaster pressure. In the past 30 years, both livelihood promotion and livelihood provision declined, and the increase in disasters pressure offset the significant increase in the quality of livelihoods in Sichuan Province. The change curve of the livelihood resilience of rural residents showed the characteristics of first rising and then descending. (ii) The impact of different natural disasters on the resilience of livelihood is different. The contribution rates of earthquake, drought and flood disaster to the resilience of livelihood were -0.9 percent, -0.8 percent, and -0.3percent respectively. Due to the fact that the research area is not divided into earthquake-stricken area, non-earthquake-stricken area, heavy stricken area and light stricken area, to a certain extent, this has weakened the negative effect of earthquake disaster on the livelihood resilience of rural residents. (iii) From central government perspective, the reform of income distribution, tax system, and to change the reality of the income growth of rural residents behind national economic development are shown to be associated with highly significant and positive impact on livelihood resilience of rural households. From local government perspective, there is need for effective policies and interventions, for example, optimization the structure of financial resources, expansion the scale and channels of financial resources, and improvement the efficiency of fiscal expenditure, that can enhance investment in the agricultural infrastructure and disaster early warning system for improving livelihood resilience. From rural household perspective, livelihood strategies, increasing in education, productive expenditure are very effective in the long term when they are complemented by appropriate public policies such as subsidies of agricultural production material, compulsory education, professional training and innovation of rural residents' perception at different scales."

Consequences of climate change, such as weather-related disasters, are set to continue even if emissions start to decrease. Increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for humans and ecosystems. Risks are unevenly felt and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries with low level of development. Here, we review the impacts of recent natural disasters in developing countries on rural agriculture and livelihoods with the objective of understanding gaps and providing recommendations. Lessons from these disasters demonstrate that national governments, aid agencies, and international/non-governmental organizations (I/NGOs) are effective primarily at distributing short-term products (e.g. food packages and tarpaulin) to cities. Such products are inexpensive, simple to procure, and easily quantifiable for donors. Unfortunately, the literature suggests that many national governments and foreign NGOs are ineffective at assisting rural farmers in the short and long term. Given that the global community is somewhat effective at distributing short-term products, we suggest that a similar strategy should be developed for rural areas, but focusing on products that can assist farm households. There appears to be a gap in knowledge of effective products that can target such households after a disaster. "
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"Earthquakes, landslides, flood, drought, fires, and hailstorms are some of the natural calamities that occur every year, at any point, and anywhere, causing threats to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and their food security. Disasters can cause loss of human and animal life, field crops, stored seeds, agricultural equipment/materials, and their supply systems (e.g. infrastructure) as well as associated indigenous knowledge, thus disrupting not only the immediate growing season but also future seasons . Rural regions of the developing world can be remote, with high concentrations of mass poverty, food insecurity, and illiteracy. hence access to food, shelter, and communication related to relief and recovery is a challenge after a disaster. In rural areas, farmers strongly rely on natural resources [8, 9] and have no alternative source of income or employment, making them more vulnerable to a crisis. Women and children, those most responsible for on-farm labour in developing countries, are most affected by post-traumatic stress after a disaster [10]. After disasters, intense media focus occurs on the cities where the images are most dramatic, whereas the needs and issues of rural farm families are often neglected. All these factors may lead to a long-term disaster in rural areas as witnessed in Haiti. Therefore, after a natural disaster, rural areas require emergency interventions to maintain livelihoods and food security, and a longer-term integrated recovery plan to minimize the possibility of a secondary disaster, as inexpensively as possible given limited local financial resources."

A decline in the dollar-a-day poverty rate in rural areas has been reported in East Asia and the Pacific region; however, rural poverty is rising notably in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. According to the United Nation’s World Food Programme, three-quarters of hungry people live in rural areas, of which 98% are in developing countries. The current literature regarding natural disasters has not focused on coping efforts to assist farmers, but rather on the post-disaster impacts on rural livelihoods, household economy, food and nutritional security, seed systems security, soil fertility, physical and mental health, population displacement , and long-term human migration  from the affected regions. A few studies have discussed government and non-governmental humanitarian systems and the efficiency of their distribution channels. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to review recent natural disasters that have affected farmers in developing nations, as case studies; (2) propose criteria for effective interventions for farmers; (3) suggest high-priority interventions based on these criteria; and finally (4) discuss distribution and logistics strategies to reach affected rural areas, with the goal of reviving agriculture and maintaining life and livelihoods in disaster-affected areas."

The earthquake affected nearly one million smallholder farmers across 24 districts, of which households headed by women and the elderly suffered the most due to migration of male members to nearby cities and abroad. The estimated total value of damage and loss to the agriculture sector was USD 284 million. The earthquake had a serious impact on the livelihoods of rural farmers as massive damage and losses occurred to crop lands, physical infrastructure, polyhouses, livestock shelters, agricultural tools, equipment, and machinery. Stored seeds were buried under the rubble. Farmers had no storage facilities for the standing spring rice and maize crops. Aid agencies, I/NGOs, and the national government were involved in providing immediate necessities such as food, water, shelter kits, and hygiene kits to the households affected by the earthquake.

Moreover, it is estimated that 1.3 million people living in Port-au-Prince had to reside in temporary shelters or tents located throughout the city, while up to 600,000 of its residents fled to rural areas of the country. The urban-to-rural migration led to food shortages and loss of biodiversity in rural areas due to the consumption of planting materials. The estimated total value of damage and loss to the agriculture sector was about USD 149 million. Damage to this sector included silting of irrigated plots and cracking of irrigation canals, as well as reported losses of seed stocks and storage facilities. Emergency relief provisions provided by aid agencies and I/NGOs, especially necessities such as tents, potable water, food and basic health care, were mostly focused on cities. Billions of dollars were spent by international funding agencies that promoted NGOs as substitutes for the state which weakened the government The support included: distribution of seeds and planting materials, hand tools, fertilizers, small animals and fishing materials, promotion of fruit tree crops for soil conservation, establishment of emergency seed stocks, seed storage and conservation, and reconstruction and reinforcement of infrastructure through cash-for-work programmes. However, no or very little attention was given to improve soil fertility (e.g. hillside erosion control, legume integration, cover crops, reforestation, livestock improvement as well as subsidies for inorganic fertilizers to quickly help rebuild soil fertility) that led to chronic poverty and malnutrition."

Infrastructure such as bridges, electric poles, and telephone towers was washed away, and the resulting loss to the means of communication delayed emergency help from the authorities . Rural households were more commonly impacted and slower to recover. The flood severely affected agriculture with an estimated loss of USD 5.1 billion (50% of the total loss), by destroying 2.4 million hectares of soon-to-be-harvested crops (e.g. sugarcane, wheat, and rice) and livestock (mostly cows and sheep). Total loss to the livestock sector alone was estimated to be USD 570 million. There was no earlier warning from authorities, and the villages quickly filled up with water at night which contributed to the massive damage to crops and livestock. The need for food aid was nearly ubiquitous; however, food aid from aid agencies and I/NGOs was relatively minor. There were limited efforts by the provincial agriculture department, which included the distribution of quality seeds (wheat and vegetables), extension services, feed, and veterinary care with the objective of assisting farmers to plant the next season of crops and keep livestock alive and healthy. Nevertheless, many of the most affected populations, including farmers and day labourers in rural areas, were less likely to receive aid due to the lack of effective coordination between the service providers (government, I/NGOs). In addition, there was inadequate identification and/or targeting of aid to the affected families."

The majority of those killed by the tsunami were poor villagers living in the most vulnerable areas along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra in Indonesia. The coastal agriculture and fisheries sectors suffered major setbacks [49]. The estimated damage and loss to the agriculture sector in Indonesia alone was USD 225 million, while the fisheries sector suffered a loss of USD 510 million. Standing rice, vegetables, plantation crops such as mangroves and tree crops, aqua farms, and livestock were severely damaged. Thousands of boats, fishing nets and gear as well as infrastructure, including ice plants and cold rooms, were damaged or destroyed. The extent of aid distribution (i.e. food and temporary shelters) delivered by the aid agencies, governments and NGOs has been reported to be pathetic despite billions of dollars generated by international communities in the aftermath of the tsunami. The Indonesian government executed a 5-year recovery programme to target the agricultural sector with a focus on addressing food security, the development of agribusiness, and enhancing the social welfare of farming communities; however, this programme was beset by challenges that included a lack of technical expertise in the reclamation and rehabilitation of saline-affected soils, resulting in reduced productivity and low farm income."

The households affected by the earthquake were mainly marginal farmers and landless labourers belonging to the schedule castes and schedule tribes. The situation in rural areas was the most severe, as the earthquake happened after two consecutive years of drought. The preliminary loss to the agriculture and livestock sectors was estimated to be USD 117 million (i.e. 5% of the total assets), nearly 80% of which was in the Kutch district. The reasons why damage to agriculture and livestock was relatively low included: agriculture was largely rainfed with no perennial crops in the field; there was no/little mechanization thus a low level of capital intensity; and the disaster hit at a time of day when cattle were grazing outdoors. Production losses were mainly associated with delays in harvesting of the standing crops (e.g. groundnuts, pearl millet, and cotton), labour shortages, and damage to irrigation and grain storage facilities. The relief and rehabilitation efforts were focused on people. Emergency relief food rations consisted of fortified blended food (i.e. Indiamix), wheat flour, and lentils which were provided to nearly 300,000 people for 4 months after the disaster. By contrast, agriculture and livestock management received no or inadequate attention. The loss of human life and livestock could have been reduced with better preparedness, a timely response and well-designed rehabilitation efforts."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"The East African nation of Ethiopia has suffered heavily from food crisis for over 50 years due to recurrent disasters such as drought, in particular the 1983–1985 famine in northern Ethiopia that led to 400,000 deaths, combined with two decades of conflicts that killed 150,000 people. The combined effects of famine and internal war led to food shortages in rural areas. The situation further escalated by a weak subsistence-agriculture-based economy, depletion of assets, absence of income diversity, and a lack of alternative coping mechanisms. The yields of major pulses (e.g. fava bean, lentil, field pea, chickpea, and grass pea) and cereals (e.g. barley) reduced substantially due to high temperatures and low rainfall combined with inadequate land preparation, low seed rates, inappropriate methods of sowing, and lack of weeding. The heavy reliance on poor cultivars, which are susceptible to climatic extremes, pests, and diseases, also led to widespread crop failure. Over 1.5 million metric tons of emergency foods were distributed at the height of the Ethiopian famine, reaching an estimated 7.1 million people, by more than 60 organizations directly working in the region. However, food aid programmes were not able to meet the demand (quantity and composition) and faced major obstacles in logistics and targeting to the vulnerable rural population. The crisis was further escalated by the government’s unwillingness to deal with the widespread famine, inappropriate handling of the relief materials (i.e. policy of withholding food shipment to rebel areas), and failure of the government’s relocation plan (i.e. villagization) due to insufficient water, schools, medical services, and utility supply points; this caused millions to lose their lives and millions more to be displaced from rural areas."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"Earthquakes, floods, cyclones, and such other hazards each year affect approximately 200 million people. Developing countries absorbed 98 percent of these disasters and accounted for nine out of ten disaster-related deaths in the period 1991-2005. In fact, low and middle income countries suffer more severe and widespread degradation than do wealthy countries, whose insurance market covers highly valued property and where sophisticated tools report absolute economic loss. To make the obvious apparent, the US$40 million losses caused by Hurricane Andrew in the United States represented 0.3 percent of gross development product (GDP), while one tsunami in the Maldives decimated 66 percent of GDP. Natural disasters, in terms of sheer loss, disproportionately impact low and middle income countries. Poverty caused by disasters poses a great challenge to consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation. Livelihood resilience is the key factor for farmers to resist risks and get rid of poverty. Therefore, this study used the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) database. Firstly, we examined the impact of natural disasters on the poverty vulnerability of farmers. Secondly, taking livelihood resilience and its decomposition dimensions as threshold variables, we examined the mechanism of livelihood resilience between natural disasters and poverty. The results show that natural disaster shocks, natural disaster intensity, and natural disaster frequency all had a significant positive effect on farm households’ vulnerability to poverty. The threshold test shows that natural disasters had larger effects on the poverty vulnerability of the farmers with lower buffer capacity, self-organizing capacity, and learning capacity. China is a country severely affected by natural disasters. In 2020, various natural disasters in China affected 138 million people, caused 5.891 million people to evacuate, damaged 1.807 million houses, and destroyed 19.958 million hectares of crops. "
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"When the livelihood resilience value exceeded the third threshold, the impact of natural disasters on the poverty vulnerability of farmers turned from positive to negative. When the buffer capacity exceeded the third threshold, the impact of natural disasters on poverty vulnerability turned from positive to negative; when the self-organizing capacity exceeded the first threshold, the impact of natural disasters on poverty vulnerability turned from positive to negative; when the learning capacity exceeded the third threshold, the impact of natural disasters on poverty vulnerability turned from positive to negative. Therefore, it is suggested that appropriate policies should be needed to support farmers’ livelihood resilience and address disaster-induced poverty by improving farmers’ buffer capacity, self-organizing capacity, and learning capacity. Focusing on farmers’ livelihood resilience, government should establish a policy support system aimed at improving farmers’ buffer capacity, self-organizing capacity, and learning capacity, that will help farmers to escape from disaster-induced poverty. Poverty caused by disasters has always been a huge challenge to consolidate poverty alleviation. Natural disasters directly affect crop production and farmers’ livelihoods, threaten farmers’ sources of income and living conditions, and easily lead non-poor farmers into poverty and those who have been lifted out of poverty back into poverty. The impact of livelihood resilience on poverty can be discussed in terms of buffer capacity, self-organizing capacity, and learning capacity. Firstly, buffer capacity represents the degree of change or disturbance that a system can withstand to maintain its structure, function, and feedback. In the farmers’ livelihood system, farmers can use existing accessible assets to cope with shocks and capture opportunities for better livelihood outcomes. For example, Wang W. et al. (2021) argued that the initial livelihood capital endowment was critical for farm households to escape from poverty. Some studies show that physical capital such as agricultural means of production, housing and durable goods are effective in reducing poverty occurrence among farm households (Shinn and Gillespie, 1994; Amendola and Vecchi, 2014; Oni and Oyelade, 2014). Secondly, self-organizing capacity describes the impact of institutions, rights and social organizational structures on livelihood resilience. Its impact on poverty can alleviate poverty through institutional systems, social organizations and groups as well as social networks (Jung, 2007; Yan, 2018). Thirdly, learning capacity emphasizes the adaptive management of systems to transform knowledge into productivity. Farmers with higher learning capacity can better participate in the urbanization and industrialization process. Thus, they can achieve a shift in livelihood strategy to escape from poverty by working away from home or starting a business (Yang, 2012; Jia et al., 2017)."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"Currently, although China has comprehensively addressed absolute poverty, large population who have escaped from poverty still lack endogenous development incentives and sustainable livelihoods. Some studies show that 15% of people who have escaped from poverty have a high risk of returning to poverty after 3–5 years (Chen et al., 2020), and nearly 2 million people in China are at risk of returning to poverty (Li, 2021). Livelihood resilience plays an important role in helping farm households to resist risks and escape from poverty. Adequate buffer capacity, learning capacity, and self-organizing capacity provide strong support for transforming farm households’ livelihood strategies and stabilizing basic returns when coping with disasters. Therefore, in order to improve farmers’ capacity to resist disasters and consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, it is of great significance to explore the impact of natural disasters on farmers’ poverty vulnerability from the perspective of livelihood resilience. The concept of resilience first appeared in the study of ecosystems to denote the ability to recover physical characteristics under ecological changes (Holling, 1973). Adger (2000) first introduced the concept of resilience into social science research. Then, resilience has gradually been applied into study the ability of human and social systems to recover livelihoods (Davidson, 2010). In studies of uncertainty and human wellbeing, the concept of resilience has been further expanded. Nowadays, livelihood resilience indicates an ability of a system to maintain its original characteristics after a shock (Tambo, 2016), which is widely used in economic organizational behavior, social-ecological systems and disaster management. In measurement of livelihood resilience, Speranza et al. (2014) built a framework of buffer capacity, self-organizing capacity, and learning capacity. Smith and Frankenberger (2018) classified livelihood resilience into absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and transformational capacity. Zhou et al. (2021a) considered livelihood resilience as an important means of addressing disaster shocks, included farmers’ disaster prevention and mitigation capacity into the research framework of livelihood resilience and measured livelihood resilience in four dimensions: buffer capacity, self-organizing capacity, learning capacity, and disaster resilience."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"In general, a wide variety of research has been conducted on the relationship between disasters and poverty as well as the relationship between livelihood resilience and poverty. However, there are still some shortcomings in existing studies. Firstly, the definition of poverty focuses more on static absolute poverty, which can only reflect the poverty status of rural households in the current period instead of dynamical future trends of poverty (Chaudhuri et al., 2002; Ligon and Schechter, 2003). The poverty vulnerability index measures the likelihood of falling into poverty for rural households in future periods, which is forward-looking for measuring the impact of disaster shocks on farm households’ poverty. Secondly, the impact of natural disasters on farm household poverty has been rarely studied from the perspective of livelihood resilience. Thus, based on the definition of poverty vulnerability and livelihood resilience, livelihood resilience was divided into buffer capacity, self-organizing capacity, and learning capacity in this paper. Furthermore, the threshold role of the three capacities between disaster and poverty was explored. This will provide a theoretical implication and decision-making insight for reducing disaster poverty risk and improving the livelihood sustainability of farm households. Disasters directly cause poverty, mainly by disaster-causing factors, disaster risks and bearers. Poverty caused by disaster-causing factors and disaster risks involves direct links between disaster and poverty. Poverty caused by disaster factors is manifested as economic losses and casualties of farmers due to natural disasters. Such impacts hit farmers’ income and consumption in the short term, causing them to be vulnerable to poverty. Poverty by disaster risks involves the hidden poverty driven by different disasters. There are differences in the impact of low-frequency and high-loss intensive disasters and high-frequency and low-loss widespread disasters on poverty of farmers. The former type mainly causes economic losses and deaths, while the latter has more cumulative indirect impacts. For example, frequent rainstorms and droughts are major causes of the continuous reduction of farmers’ agricultural income and precarious livelihoods."
LOSS_OF_LIVELIHOODS,"The impoverishment of bearing bodies is manifested in that different hazard bearing bodies in the same intensity of disasters magnify the losses of disasters due to higher cost value and lower livelihood resilience in the face of disasters. That is, the difference in the livelihood resilience of the carrier may lead to changes in the direction or intensity of the effect of disasters on poverty (Wilhite et al., 2007). Livelihood resilience can be further divided into buffer capacity, self-organizing capacity, and learning capacity according to its roles and functions in anti-poverty. Firstly, as the households’ ability to resist risks, buffer capacity is responsible for smoothing households’ production and consumption, by which the household’s primary welfare is maintained. Low buffer capacity will exacerbate the risk of disaster shocks and prevent farmers from adjusting production and livelihoods in time to adapt to environmental changes. Consequently, farmers will fall into poverty trap. In contrast, for those with sufficient buffer capacity, this short-term impact is too limited to change their livelihood sources. Secondly, self-organizing capacity represents the farmers’ ability to integrate into the local economy, society and institutional environment. When farmers are affected by disasters, components including environmental and institutional factors are critical to helping farmers effectively get rid of the predicament. For example, factors such as convenient transportation and organizational participation are conducive to farmers adopting non-agricultural employment to respond to disaster shocks and mitigate the negative impact of disasters. Thus, these will help farmers get rid of poverty. Farmers with low self-organizing capacity cannot integrate into neighboring systems and organizations when dealing with disasters. It is difficult to avoid disaster risks and thus farmers may fall into poverty. Thirdly, learning capacity represents the farmers’ ability to adapt to disturbances. When the livelihood development of farmers is exposed to short-term disaster shocks, it can help farmers cope with the impact of short-term disasters. However, with the increase of external disturbances and their duration, farmers need to constantly adapt to external disturbances while improving their abilities. In the changing environment, farmers with strong learning capacity can change their livelihood strategies in real time and take adaptive measures such as labor transfer and non-agricultural employment to alleviate the sharp fall in income caused by disaster shocks. Farmers with weak learning ability are unable to cope with disaster shocks by changing their livelihood strategies and can only engage in agricultural production, which aggravates their poverty vulnerability."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Natural disasters caused $56.9 billion in property damage in 2021, according to a new climate change catastrophe report from CoreLogic. Wildfires, floods, twisters and winter freezes hit nearly every major market with no signs of slowing down. Since 1980, tropical cyclones by far have caused the most home damage, coming in at over $1.1 trillion. Hurricanes bring high winds along with potential flooding that can hit homes at the same time. Hurricanes like Harvey, Irma and Maria cause a range of damage from the high winds, heavy rains and storm surge. The force from high winds and storm surges can tear homes apart and can batter homes with collected debris. The heavy rains and water from the storm surge can cause serious flooding. Natural causes of property damage include wind, fire, hail, flooding, and freezing. Types of property damage caused by a person may include intentional acts (such as theft) and negligence. What happens if your house gets destroyed by a natural disaster? FEMA has housing assistance programs for people whose homes have been destroyed including: Replacement: Financial assistance may be available to help with any additional cost of replacing your home that isn't covered by insurance. Find more information on FEMA's housing assistance programs. Property damage is injury to real or personal property. An example could be a tornado on a piece of real estate, or damage to a house from a flood. Property owners can obtain property insurance to protect against the risk of property damage. Your home insurance policy covers many natural disasters and weather events, including wind, hail, lightning strikes and wildfires. However, it does not cover damage caused by floods or earthquakes. You would need a separate policy for each of these perils. Many homeowners may not realize this until it's too late. From the destruction of buildings to the spread of disease, natural disasters can devastate entire countries overnight. Tsunamis, earthquakes and typhoons do not just wreak havoc on land; they also disrupt people's lives in both densely populated cities and remote villages."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Depending on where you live, your home is susceptible to one type of natural disaster or another. Some disasters, like a wildfire or tornado, can completely destroy your home, while others, like a flood, can cause you a lot of headaches with repairs. According to a CoreLogic study, one in every ten homes gets damaged by a natural disaster every year, so always be on the lookout when the news reports an impending natural disaster in your area. In 2021, there were 20 weather events that each caused at least a billion dollars worth of damage to homes in the United States. Every year, the number seems to be going up. Since 1980 there has been around $2.1 trillion in damages from natural disasters. These are the natural disasters that caused the most damage and how you can prepare your seller for them as an agent. Since 1980, tropical cyclones by far have caused the most home damage, coming in at over $1.1 trillion. Hurricanes bring high winds along with potential flooding that can hit homes at the same time. These damages occurred primarily across the Southeastern United States including Florida, Louisana, and Texas. The peak season for hurricanes is from late July into early October. As an agent, you should know a few things when trying to sell during hurricane season. Talk to your client about hurricane proofing their home by adding permanent shutters or impact-resistant glass to minimize potential damage. It even adds value to the home. Severe storms came in second in total damages since 1980, with $330 billion in damages. These storms are most likely to occur in the spring and summer and consist of tornadoes, hail, and high winds. Tornadoes and the potential 100-300 mph winds they bring can devastate an area. Winds can rip houses from their foundations and any debris can act like a missile, causing major structural damage. One way you can help your client make their home more attractive in tornado-prone areas is to trim any trees that are within falling distance of the home."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Wildfires and droughts have caused $120 billion worth of damage in the last 30 years. The size and amount of fires in the Western United States continue to grow every year as the droughts that cause them last longer and longer. The states with the largest areas devastated by fires are California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana. If firefighters can't contain these fires, they can wipe out entire communities within minutes. Not only do fires affect houses, but droughts can cause foundations to crack, shift, or sink, making for costly repairs. Be sure the home you are working with meets the latest fire code in states like California. The current landscaping may need altering to create a defensible space of 100 feet around the home. Flooding caused $164 billion in damages across the country since 1980. While flooding can happen due to severe storms and hurricanes, the worst times for it occur in the spring when areas get large amounts of water from snowmelt and rain at the same time. Areas like the Mississippi and Missouri River basins are the most flood-prone areas in the country. To prepare a buyer looking at houses in a flood plain, do your research and see if the potential house is in a high or low flood risk area. Make sure they get flood insurance as well to protect their investment. While winter storms have caused the least amount of damage since 1980, with $78 billion, the damage is still felt throughout the areas they affect. Typically, heavy snow can cause damage to gutters or roof collapse in severe cases, while freezing temperatures may cause pipes to burst. Winter storms cause the most damage when they hit warmer climate areas that aren't expecting them. These homes weren't built to withstand the stress of the cold and snow, causing potentially severe damage. Natural disasters like winter storms affect the value of homes across the country. There are a few things you can do to make a house more capable of standing up to cold winter storms. Use spray-in insulation in the attic and walls to help retain heat. You can also insulate water pipes with pipe wrap to prevent them from freezing. Outside of the house, you can prune any trees that may potentially fall towards the house during heavy snow or ice storms."

Selling during this time period can affect the home price if it gets damaged, and it also affects the title insurance. Learn the best time of year to sell a house and more. Natural disasters are predicted to become more severe with climate change. Research on impacts of natural disasters on housing markets is mostly limited to hedonic property studies and does not consider impacts on home ownership. Combining historical data on natural disasters in the United States with household data, we use a differences-in-differences approach to estimate the effects of natural disasters on home ownership rates. Results indicate a 3–5-percentage-point decrease in the home ownership rate among households that migrate to areas hit by severe natural disasters. An updating of risk priors given additional information regarding recent disasters may be responsible for such decreases. These results improve our understanding of how natural disasters impact housing markets and inform urban policy responses to climate change. As climate change progresses and global average temperature rises, natural disasters are becoming more frequent and severe . There is a growing literature assessing economic vulnerability in the face of increasing disasters (e.g., Mechler and Bouwer 2015). Policy makers in urban areas such as New York City are beginning to assess potential future damage and think about how this damage could be mitigated via adaptive measures. They report that 18% of 401 large cities in their study are planning toward an adaptation policy. Household responses to this changing climate could significantly impact real estate markets, the composition of housing stock, and where households choose to locate. In this paper, we analyze home ownership decisions of households moving to areas that recently experienced natural disasters. Understanding to what extent environmental risks act as a barrier to home ownership has important implications for the design of public housing policies and private property insurance products. "
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Household responses to this changing climate could significantly impact real estate markets, the composition of housing stock, and where households choose to locate. In this paper, we analyze home ownership decisions of households moving to areas that recently experienced natural disasters. Understanding to what extent environmental risks act as a barrier to home ownership has important implications for the design of public housing policies and private property insurance products. Home ownership is a crucial means of wealth accumulation and serves as a measure of financial security, especially for low- and moderate-income households. Thus, housing tenure choices in response to natural disasters may impact long-run economic inequality and racial disparity. We find that natural disasters decrease home ownership levels of incoming migrants in the second year following the disaster. Since we do not find a significant impact on subsequent migrants, this could lead to a longer-run change in the relative proportions of home owners and renters. This effect may also lead to gradual shifts in local population toward renting in vulnerable areas that frequently experience disasters as climate change progresses. Research on impacts of natural disasters on housing markets is mostly limited to hedonic property studies on markets that have experienced a flood event. These studies find that housing prices decrease and/or flood insurance uptake increases following a flood, but these impacts dissipate after several years. Other studies look at impacts of natural disasters on risk preferences (Bchir and Willinger 2013; Ingwersen 2014; Miao and Popp 2014; Page et al. 2014; Berlemann et al. 2015; Cameron and Shah 2015; Samphantharak and Chantarat 2015) or impacts of new environmental risk information on housing prices (Gayer et al. 2000, 2002; McCluskey and Rausser 2001; Davis 2004; Currie et al. 2013). However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing study analyzes the impact of natural disasters on home ownership rates, another key component to understanding impacts on housing markets. Conditional on general equilibrium price changes, we attempt to isolate and identify the preference shock to households’ decisions to rent or own following a disaster."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Information on the housing market can play an important role in the housing tenure choices of households (Haurin and Morrow-Jones 2006). Frequent natural disasters not only cause damage to the existing housing stock but also indicate increased risk for homeowners and may thus affect owner-occupancy propensities. The literature on housing demand shows that the uncertainty linked to owning homes is negatively associated with the likelihood of home ownership attainment (Robst et al. 1999; Ortalo-Magne and Rady 2002; Diaz-Serrano 2005a, 2005b; Davidoff 2006; Moriizumi and Naoi 2011). Yet almost all of these studies focus on income uncertainty and housing price variability, which influence home ownership rates due to either risk aversion or credit constraints (Diaz-Serrano 2005b). Since natural disasters have little immediate effect on the budget constraints of households that are not directly affected by the disasters, we can better disentangle the channels through which the risk of owning matters to the housing tenure choices. In particular, we estimate the effect of severe natural disasters on home ownership rates using a differences-in-differences approach. We restrict our sample to households migrating into a county from a noncontiguous state and compare home ownership rates of households moving into counties that experienced one or more severe natural disasters 2 years ago to counties that did not experience a severe natural disaster. Long-distance migration is more likely to be induced by reasons exogenous to the disasters that occurred at the destination, such as job relocation.1 Also, these migrants only make up a very small share of all the households that changed residence during the past year, so they are unlikely to drive the housing price in the market. Our sample is therefore not directly affected by the natural disaster—rather, they move into an area that was previously affected. Hence, conditional on the sale and rental prices, changes in home ownership rates are more likely a result of the updating of households’ priors on natural disaster risk given new information provided by the recent disaster rather than a change in risk preferences."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"This information-based mechanism is consistent with what Gallagher (2014) and McCoy and Zhao (2018) propose in their papers. Furthermore, the 2-year lag that we allow between the natural disaster and households’ decisions to rent or own allows time for property damage to be repaired so that, unlike hedonic property analyses, our estimated housing market impacts are less likely to be conflated with property damage and temporary constraints on housing and rental stocks. Since treatment and control populations live in similar areas and since we control for housing and rental prices, our empirical strategy is robust to major macroeconomic events such as the Great Recession that may have differentially impacted housing markets across regions. In our theoretical model, natural disasters affect housing tenure decisions due to changes in expected owner costs and risk of home ownership. Migrants update their priors based on information on recent disasters, which is likely conveyed in the media and more significant for severe disasters. We define severity based on fatalities rather than property damage for two reasons. First, fatalities are likely to be more salient in the news. Second, property damage may be a poorer proxy for severity since damage depends on the property value at risk.2 Finally, we use a threshold of three fatalities to define a severe disaster year. This is consistent with Drakos and Kutan (2003), who find that events resulting in more than three fatalities are more likely to receive national news coverage. Since the threshold of three fatalities is still somewhat arbitrary, we also perform robustness checks using thresholds of one and five fatalities. Our paper is novel for two main reasons. First, to the best of our knowledge, we offer the first estimate of the impact of natural disasters on home ownership rates. This complements hedonic property studies to allow for a more complete characterization of natural disaster impacts on housing markets. Second, unlike related studies, we do not restrict our analysis to one type of natural disaster. We include many types of natural disasters in our study."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Using a full national sample of movers and a nearest-neighbor matched sample, we find that a severe natural disaster decreases home ownership by 3–5 percentage points. More salient disasters result in a greater decline in the propensity of owning homes (or a greater increase in the proportion of movers who choose to delay the purchase of a home). Coastal disasters and flood and rain events appear to be the major culprits for the negative effect. Research on impacts of natural disasters on housing markets is mostly limited to hedonic property studies on markets that have experienced a flood event. Houses that face a higher risk of a natural disaster should sell at a discount to other houses, all else equal. Various hedonic property studies find that this is true, at least immediately following the natural disaster. Atreya and Ferreira (2015) find that following a large flood event, prices fell more for houses in an inundated area than other houses in the flood plain that were not inundated. The authors conclude that this is evidence that homeowners respond more to visual information than to other information, such as flood plain maps. In a study of Carteret County, North Carolina, Bin et al. (2008) also find that location within a flood zone lowers property value and that housing price differentials are roughly equivalent to the capitalized value of flood insurance premiums. Hidano et al. (2015) use a spatial two-dimensional regression discontinuity approach to find a significant price discount for houses in Tokyo located in areas with relatively high seismic hazard risk. With complete information about natural disaster risks and rational homeowners, we would expect risk-based housing price differentials to persist so long as risk differentials persist. However, research suggests that the natural disaster risk discount diminishes over time. Using a differences-in-differences approach, Atreya et al. (2013) find that house prices fell significantly in Dougherty County, Georgia, after a 100-year flood event. However, the price discount disappeared after 4 years following the flood. "

Bin and Landry (2013) find no flood zone price differential in Pitt County, North Carolina, prior to Hurricane Fran in 1996. However, they find a 5.7% and 8.8% decrease in flood zone housing prices following Hurricane Fran and Hurricane Floyd, respectively. Furthermore, they find that these price differentials attenuate to zero after 5–6 years. Using a national panel data set and an event study framework, Gallagher (2014) finds that a large flood event results in a sharp increase in flood insurance take-up, which then declines steadily over 9 years back to the baseline. The author also shows that this take-up is larger for residents of flooded communities than nonflooded communities in the same television media market and that dissipation in take-up is faster in communities whose populations increase after the flood. These studies suggest that homeowners may have a tendency to forget about past events or perhaps that incoming migrants have incomplete information about past events. New information and experience impact homeowners’ risk priors. For example, there is a large literature on how differing environmental and health risks impact housing prices and how housing prices react to new information regarding these risks. Currie et al. (2013) find that houses located within a mile radius of toxic pollutant-emitting industrial plants decline (increase) in value by 1.5% when the plants open (close). Davis (2004) estimates that housing prices in a county in Nevada fell approximately 15% due to a severe increase in pediatric leukemia likely due to an environmental risk factor. Gayer et al. (2000) incorporate Bayesian learning into a hedonic property model to estimate the impact of new risk information on housing prices and find that housing prices in the Greater Grand Rapids, Michigan, area near Superfund sites respond rationally to new information from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In this model, households have a prior based on national, regional, or other general information or assumptions about their risk. "
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Understanding how natural disasters impact housing markets is an important consideration for planning and policy making as climate change progresses and the frequency and severity of natural disasters increases. Previous literature has examined how some disasters, mostly floods, influence housing prices. We offer the first study that evaluates how natural disasters affect home ownership rates. Our findings, combined with the hedonic property literature, offer a more complete picture of the impact of disastrous events on housing markets. Our study is also novel in that it includes a variety of natural disaster types across the entire country, thus offering better external validity than existing studies. Using a differences-in-differences approach, we estimate how treatment impacts home ownership rates. Our definition of a treated household is one that moves to a county or a PUMA that experienced one or more severe natural disasters 2 years prior. We define severe natural disasters to be one or more that resulted in more than three fatalities at a location in a year. We find that natural disasters cause a decrease in home ownership. Explicitly, households who move to a location that experienced a natural disaster 2 years prior are between 3 and 5 percentage points less likely to own a home 1 year after migration. The estimated effect is about 4 percentage points when using a full national sample and close to 5 when trimming the sample to include only treated households and untreated households with similar characteristics. When examining the impacts of natural disasters by type, we find the greatest effects for coastal disasters, significant effects for flood and rain, and no significant effects for wind or winter disasters. Moreover, the effect of natural disasters on home ownership is smaller, though statistically significant, when reclassifying natural disasters with more than one fatality or damage great enough to qualify for FEMA assistance as severe. In contrast, the estimated effect is larger, between 4 and 12 percentage points, when we use five fatalities as the cutoff. These results may suggest that the impact of natural disasters on home ownership is greater the more severe a natural disaster."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Disasters can strike anybody at any time, resulting in catastrophic property damage and loss. Fires in dwellings and natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, severe storms, mudslides, and wildfires cause significant property damage every year across the United States. Although disasters usually strike without warning, there are measures you can take both before and after they strike to protect your property and your finances. Residential fires occur frequently in the United States. Although your risk of experiencing a natural disaster depends on where you live, every state has experienced some type of natural disaster. Floods and flash floods are the most common, occurring in all 50 states. Although hurricanes primarily damage islands and coastal areas, they can move inland, spawn dangerous thunderstorms and tornadoes, and produce rain that can cause massive flooding. Tornadoes occur most commonly in the Southeast and Midwest, but they can strike almost every state. Earthquakes may be more common in the West, but over the last 100 years, earthquakes have occurred in 39states. To find out what disasters are most likely to strike your community, contact your local emergency management office or American Red Cross chapter. Homeowner’s policies don't cover damage from flooding. However, you can purchase flood insurance separately. The cost of flood insurance depends on many factors, including the type of occupancy (e.g., single family, nonresidential), the amount of coverage, and the location, design, and age of the building."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Although you can't prevent a disaster from destroying your home or possessions, you can prevent it from destroying your finances by purchasing adequate insurance. If you own a home, you'll need to buy a homeowners policy that offers replacement cost coverage or guaranteed replacement cost coverage. While a standard homeowners policy pays only for the actual cash value of your home, replacement cost coverage will rebuild your home up to the limits of your policy, regardless of its actual cash value. Guaranteed replacement cost coverage provides further protection and will pay to rebuild your house regardless of policy limits, even if it costs more to rebuild your house than it did to build it originally, as a result of increased material and labor costs and building code changes. It may be a good idea to opt for replacement cost coverage for your personal possessions as well. The drawback is that this coverage may be significantly more expensive than standard coverage. In addition, consider specialized types of coverage that will insure your property specifically against natural disasters that are likely to occur where you live. Don't wait to buy specialized types of insurance until hurricane season or until you hear on the news that flooding is imminent in your area. Your insurance carrier will likely refuse to underwrite the policy until awaiting period is over."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"If you have a mortgage on your home, it's likely that your lender required a flood hazard search on your property at the time you obtained your mortgage in order to comply with federal standards. If your home turns out to be in a flood hazard area, you will be required to purchase flood insurance. However, even if you own your home outright or don't live in an area that lies in a flood plain, consider purchasing flood insurance to protect your property Flooding doesn't happen only along the banks of rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water; it can also occur in other low-lying areas or in areas where drainage is poor, or it can result from heavy rains, melting snow, and backed-up sewers, among other things. If your insurance company doesn't sell flood insurance, visit floodsmart.govfor a list of insurers in your area that do sell flood insurance policies. If your area was recently struck by a flood and you have difficulty purchasing flood insurance, you may be able to purchase coverage through a state or federally operated insurance pool, although you'll pay more for coverage. Homeowners and renters’ policies do not cover earthquake damage, so if you want to insure your property against this type of natural disaster, you'll need to purchase earthquake insurance. Unfortunately, earthquake insurance is expensive. Premiums vary widely from state to state depending on many factors such as the type and age of the structure and its proximity to fault lines, and you usually have to satisfy a high deductible before your policy will pay for damage. Most earthquake policies cover only the actual structure, so contents may have to be insured separately. However, if you live in an area where earthquakes are common, you should consider purchasing this insurance despite its expense."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE," Most earthquake policies cover only the actual structure, so contents may have to be insured separately. However, if you live in an area where earthquakes are common, you should consider purchasing this insurance despite its expense. You can do several things to reduce the likelihood that afire, storm, or other natural disaster will destroy your property and possessions. First, before buying, building, or renting a home, evaluate the structure’s location. Is it in an area at high risk for some type of natural disaster? If so, consider living somewhere else if you want to reduce your risk. If you are building a home, make sure that it is constructed according to the existing building code, and have a building inspector, architect, or fire department inspector suggest ways to protect the house from certain hazards. If you already own or rent a home, you may be able to improve it substantially without spending a lot of money. For instance, you may want to bolt tall furniture to the walls and install latches on cupboards to prevent damage and injuries that can occur when your possessions fall during an earthquake. You may want to keep most of your important documents and valuables in a safety-deposit box to ensure they are safe from fire and natural disasters. However, if you use these documents or possessions frequently, you may prefer to keep them in your home. No matter where they are stored, make sure they are readily accessible if you need them in a hurry when a disaster strikes. One way to do this is to store them in a box that can be carried out of your home quickly and easily. This evacuation box should be waterproof and fireproof and should contain marriage and birth certificates, insurance paperwork, titles, wills, passports, and a copy of the previous year's tax return. "
PROPERTY_DAMAGE," You may also want to put a list of important phone numbers and addresses in the box, a list of your bank account and Social Security numbers, and copies of your safety-deposit box keys and car keys.You may choose to keep some paperwork in a safety-deposit box and some in an evacuation box in your home. For instance, never store your original will in a safety-deposit box, because the box may be sealed at the time of your death. However, you may want to keep things in your safety-deposit box that take up a lot of space or that need special protection, such as jewelry, copies of photographs or negatives, appraisals of valuable items, copies of your home inventory, a list of credit card numbers, and copies of important paperwork. It's important to have access to cash to help you survive the weeks or months following a disaster. First, even if you have insurance, you will likely have to pay a deductible before your coverage kicks in, and your insurance won’t compensate you for all of your increased living expenses if your home is partially or totally destroyed. In addition, people living in areas that experience severe damage may lose their jobs temporarily or permanently when businesses are unable to open because the business has been damaged or destroyed or because utilities are cut off. Although some disaster help is available from charities or from the government, it won't be enough to cover all your expenses. You should aim to keep funds for at least three to six months' worth of living expenses in an emergency cash reserve account (e.g., a savings account or money market account) that can be easily liquidated."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE," After a catastrophe strikes your property, call your insurance agent or company as soon as possible and ask that an appraiser be sent right away. Ask for advice about making emergency repairs, but don't hire any contractors until clearing it with your insurance company. Find out if you are entitled to any money for living expenses under your insurance contract. While you're waiting for an appraiser, take photos of damage to your property and gather records that you have, including your household inventory and receipts for expensive items that you might own. If you don't have a household inventory, you'll have to rely on your memory and old photos of your home to make a list of things destroyed. Providing as much information as possible about losses will help ensure that your claim is settled quickly and fairly. You should also keep careful notes of your conversations with the adjusters and check over all paperwork and supporting records to make sure the settlement is fair. If you believe it’s not, you can appeal the settlement offer to your insurance company or try to settle your claim through arbitration. After you receive your settlement, keep it in a liquid account, because you'll need the money soon to replace, repair, or rebuild your property. After you are struck by a catastrophe, you should seek information and/or financial assistance from one or more of the government agencies, private programs, or nonprofit organizations that help victims of natural and other disasters. If you have lost property in a fire, contact your local fire department or American Red Cross chapter for information on what assistance is available in your community. If you are the victim of a natural disaster, numerous other sources of help may be available. For instance, you may be able to apply for help from state and local government disaster relief programs, and you can also seek assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). "
PROPERTY_DAMAGE," FEMA can provide emergency housing or assistance to cover the cost-of-living expenses and hotel accommodations. You may receive allow-interest loan or a cash grant. If you don't have insurance, or your insurance is inadequate, you may be eligible to receive a low-interest loan from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) or the Small Business Administration (SBA).You can also apply for a cash grant foreman if you don't qualify for a loan. For more information on disaster relief programs, contact the American Red Cross or FEMA. A personal (nonbusiness) casualty or theft loss may be deductible if the loss is incurred in a federally declared disaster area. You can generally deduct the loss in either the year it occurred or in the tax year immediately preceding the loss. Volcanoes, hurricanes, and polar vortexes—oh, my! From the ongoing eruption of the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii, to huge winter storms, massive mudslides, and the unfortunately reliable hurricane it seems like natural disasters have been near constant over the past year. In addition to the catastrophic toll these events take on people and communities, the toll on a business can be high. Understanding the full range and implications of your company’s risks, and putting the right coverage in place to protect against those risks, is vital. When a natural disaster strikes, having appropriate levels of property damage, business interruption and contingent business interruption insurance can be three keys to stability. When it comes to insuring property damage from natural disasters, it is an essential point that your business has sufficient coverage for the types of weather and natural events likely to cause it damage. Property policies typically cover fire damage up to policy limits, but often include lower sublimits, higher deductibles and other conditions on coverage for damage caused by flooding, windstorms or mudslides—or may exclude them altogether. For example, a policy could have a sublimit for damage resulting from earthquakes, and usually will have a sublimit that could reduce the amount of coverage available for particular costs, like debris removal. "
PROPERTY_DAMAGE," Policies that cover flood events or windstorms typically do so with a much smaller limit, and the limits for floods may depend on whether losses occur within flood zones designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Before placing insurance, it is important to know the flood zones that your operations are located in and to negotiate limits appropriate to the contingencies that may apply there. You should be sure to tailor your property damage coverage to the types of weather events and disasters particular to your area of operation. Business interruption coverage goes hand in hand with property damage coverage. Your property damage insurance covers damage to your physical property, but such damage or the threat of it may also result in significant disruptions to your operations. Business interruption insurance goes a step further than property insurance, generally providing coverage for lost profits and extra expenses arising from property damage. It typically also provides coverage for losses cause by civil authority orders that prevent access to your property, provided property damage of the type covered occurred, usually within a specific radius of your property and even if not to your property itself. And it often provides coverage for “expediting expenses”—additional costs you incur to get your business up and running sooner, either at the same or at an alternative location—as well as for other costs you incur to mitigate covered losses. But be aware that in some policies, the insurer’s approval may be required before such expediting expenses are occurred. "
PROPERTY_DAMAGE," When placing coverage, it is important to evaluate whether the policy includes these additional coverages and that the terms, such as any radius within which property damage must occur for civil authority coverage to apply, are realistic and provide the coverage you expect to need. When a storm or other event shuts you down, a more complete package of business interruption insurance can help keep the business itself afloat. What if your property is lucky enough to avoid any direct or even local damage, but you still lose business because of damage to your customers or your supply chain? Enter contingent business interruption (CBI) insurance. If a natural disaster keeps your supplier from providing goods and services, or prevents your customers from receiving your products, CBI coverage may help protect against those losses even if the disaster occurred far way. CBI coverage can be limited, however. For example, some CBI policies only cover losses resulting from damage to a “direct” supplier as opposed to an “indirect” supplier, a distinction that often leads to coverage disputes. As a policyholder, you should make sure you fully understand the supply chain behind your suppliers, and make sure that any CBI policy covers interruption of your major customers and suppliers. A natural disaster often strikes without warning, so consider this a friendly reminder to make sure you have the right insurance coverage for your business before it suffers a loss. And remember, it is always a good idea to reach out to coverage counsel to understand the coverage you have, and the coverage you need, so that whether you’re faced with wind, rain, snow or lava, your business can move forward to sunnier days ahead."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE," In 2021 alone nearly 15 million homes across America were ravaged by natural disasters, from wildfires and hurricanes to blizzards and tornadoes. And that cost an estimated $56.92 billion in property damage. CoreLogic, a global property data company, published its 2021 CoreLogic Climate Change Catastrophe Report which analyzed over 120 million residential structures across the country. The results showed that about 1 in 10 U.S. residential properties were impacted by natural disasters last year. Over the years, natural disasters have increased in frequency and severity, and that’s impacted regions in parts of the U.S. that were unprepared to handle the situation. In its wake, the disasters led to economic disruption, job displacement and other destruction of real estate assets. Take the state of Texas, which experienced record-breaking cold temperatures last year that resulted in the state’s power grid nearly collapsing. Millions of Texans were left without power during low temperatures, snow and freezing rain. At least 11 people were killed as a result of the winter storm. On the other side of the country, wildfires in California are expected to grow by the end of the century due to climate change. Researchers estimated the number of large fire days will increase from 36 days a year to 58 days under a moderate greenhouse gas emission scenario. It could jump up to 71 days a year under a high emission scenario. However, out of all the different types of severe weather events, CoreLogic found winter storms impacted 12.7 million homes across the U.S., causing 15 billion in property damage. Second was hurricanes, which impacted 1.2 million homes and caused 33 billion in property damage.  "
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"The reconstruction costs that stem from property damage are hefty, and the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the cost of rebuilding homes and infrastructure. That’s also reflected in the cost of homeowners insurance, with CoreLogic’s report calculating from 2017 to 2020 the total written premium in the state of California for dwelling fire and homeowners’ insurance combined increased by more than 27 percent, from $8.7 billion to $11.1 billion. The risk of severe weather isn’t consistent, as every natural disaster has its own unique consequences. For wildfires, damage caused by fire, smoke, ash, odor and burn are all factors that play into the damage properties could sustain and how much insurance coverage will cost. Hurricanes carry risk factors related to damage caused by wind, storm surge and inland flooding. Winter storms can cause damage to homes related to water, burst pipes, poor insulation and other storm effects. CoreLogic says the bottom line is for all parties to understand the possible severity of potential natural disasters, from insurers, mortgage and financial professionals to homeowners themselves. Such preparedness can protect homeownership, insurer portfolios and shield the housing market from collapse. “Insurers and lenders can leverage the latest technologies and work cross-functionally to better understand this risk, protect homeowners and enable faster recovery times,” said Tom Larsen, principal of CoreLogic’s industry solutions. The U.S. has experienced 18 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each, as of October of this year. These events have included a drought, two floods, nine severe storms, four tropical cyclones, one wildfire and a winter storm, according to the National Climate Data Center."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Whether you're a renter or a homeowner, preparation is key, says Jeffrey Hussey, the director of Public Interest & Litigation at Community Legal Services of Mid-Florida, a nonprofit law firm. “Mistakes can be made if you are rushing or panicked,"" he says. ""If you are prepared and have a plan, you can lessen the impact a natural disaster has on you and your family."" For renters dealing with the aftermath of a natural disaster, whether it is an apartment or a home that was damaged or destroyed, here are a few tips provided by the Community Legal Services of Mid-Florida to consider. As soon as it is safe, inspect your residence to figure out what damage has occurred and tell your landlord about the property damage to your residence. Your landlord can arrange for repairmen to come to the property. Ask your landlord to keep you informed of the plans and timeframe for the repairs. The best way to notify your landlord is with a written request for repairs. In your request, ask how long it will take for repairs to be completed. Mail your written repair request using certified mail with a return receipt or a service that tracks delivery (UPS, FedEx, USPS mail). Keep the return receipt for your records. You should re-read your lease to understand the repairs that you and landlord are responsible for making on the residence. If you don’t have a copy of your lease, ask your landlord for one. When a disaster occurs, the most important terms in your lease are the rent abatement or lease termination provisions. You have the right to terminate your lease if a significant part of the property is damaged or completely unusable. You also have the right to reduced rent until the property is completely repaired."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"The earthquakes exposed a large number of known and new natural hazards such as landslips, rock-fall, and landslide dams. They also caused significant damage to land – such as cracking, lateral spread, and liquefaction – under and around people’s homes, businesses and farms. Natural hazards and land damage can pose risks to people’s lives, safety, health and well-being. They can reduce the value of people’s homes and land. This, in turn, can impact on whether people can afford to rebuild or to carry on using their land and property in the way they did prior to the earthquake. Primary accountability for managing and mitigating risks from natural hazards and land damage sits with local and regional councils. However, during recovery, central government agencies play a role in supporting councils to keep people safe; and to identify and implement options for managing and mitigating risks. There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach for how hazards and risks should be identified or managed – nor is there an agreed threshold for determining ‘intolerable risk’ to people. Each case needs to be assessed on its merits. Risk management options range from accepting a risk, to avoiding it altogether (for example, by prohibiting access to, or use of, an area). The underlying policy is that people retain their existing use rights following an emergency unless they are specifically restricted from doing so – and that they are not compensated for any restrictions on use where these do occur. There is no standard government policy to compensate landowners for their capital losses, or the costs of relocating, when the risks are deemed too high for existing land-uses to continue. Private insurance cover is provided where buildings or proximate land sustain damage, but not to compensate for a natural hazard risk (except where EQC determines that a property is at ‘imminent risk’ of damage (or further damage) arising from the same event)."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"When a natural disaster strikes, major disaster databases tend to compile information about losses such as damages to property or cost of repairs, but other economic impacts after the disaster are often overlooked such as how a company's lost ability to produce products may affect the entire supply-chain within the affected region and in other regions. This may give an incomplete picture of the full financial impact of the disaster. Without using the right model to study these losses, the data may give an incomplete picture of the full financial impact of the disaster as it doesn't fully portray business interruptions incurred locally, or by trade partners, after the event. As a result, a locality may receive less than it should in state or federal government recovery support. In a recent study, published in Earth System Dynamics, an interdisciplinary journal devoted to the study of Earth and global change, economists at the University of Illinois partnered with atmospheric scientists and hydrologists from U of I and UCLA, and with the Army Corps of Engineers to capture the characteristics of an atmospheric river a transporter of water vapor in the sky that hit the western part of Washington State in 2007. This event resulted in record flooding (a 500-year stream peak event in some parts of the river) and record damages. The team hopes to show that carefully selecting the characteristics of the extreme weather event under study and the correct model to estimate losses based on characteristics of the disaster and the affected region, and on the interdependence between one area and another can help in determining vulnerability and preparing for future disasters, from an economic standpoint."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"The ripple effects from a disaster can be significant if major industrial chains are disrupted when infrastructure is comprised. For instance, while the study finds that intersectoral and interregional linkages add up to around 10 percent in standard economic damage estimates in the small rural area chosen in this study, that share could go up to 50-70 percent for a major metropolitan area like Houston, Texas, because of its enormous transportation system and interregional trade. ""Let's say for instance that a company producing tires is flooded. Obviously, no tires are coming from that company,"" Dall'Erba explains. ""The car company, which could be located in a place that wasn't flooded, suddenly is expecting a delay in the tires that are not coming on time anymore. There are all of these connections from one city to the next that are traditionally not accounted for after a disaster."" In his U of I lab, the Regional Economic Applications Laboratory (REAL), Dall'Erba studies very specific disaster events using a technique called input-output -- a technique that shows the interdependencies between the sectors within a region and across different regions. He also teaches this technique in his home department (ACE) on a regular basis. We look at each industry. What kind of products and services do they buy? To whom do they sell their goods and services? In the case of Chehalis, Washington, that was flooded in 2007, it was mainly companies selling to other companies, not to individual households. Those are the kinds of links that we try to include in the work we do in REAL, how to understand that level of dependence between one location and other places. We also provide measurements that are very specific to each locality,"" Dall'Erba says."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"This paper is part of a Deep South National Science Challenge project on insurance and other liability for compensation for damages suffered to housing from coastal hazards associated with sea-level rise. There are a range of issues addressed in this project, presently divided into different discussion papers. One of the other papers focuses on the New Zealand Earthquake Commission insurance and compensation scheme, and how well it might provide for compensation for damage from sea-level rise hazards. A second paper discusses local government liability issues related to sea-level rise. A third paper considers how to better uphold principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in adaptation decision-making. A fourth will address local government barriers and enablers to adaptation. This paper considers some examples of where financial risks to property have fallen both in New Zealand and overseas as a result of some natural disasters, particularly flooding. Pre-existing schemes are important for discussing possible future policy responses as they are and how they could be adapted for new and different natural hazards. Risks relating to sea-level rise challenge how insurance currently operates due to their nonrandom nature. A non-random risk event which effects related areas such as sea-level rise incentivises insurers to withdraw from risk rather than face financial instability. Insurers internationally have already withdrawn from covering some areas, and locally have recently withdrawn from covering certain property damage unrelated to sea-level rise. For example, since Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, USA insurers have shifted relevant risks onto state and federal insurance schemes, as well as to individual property owners."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Natural disasters like hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes damage and destroy land vital to peoples’ livelihoods. They kill titleholders, destroy land records and erase boundaries. To compound the problem, the location of refugee camps, the relocation of affected communities and measures to increase future resilience such as no-construction zones are fraught with tensions and difficulties. The changing climate is making extreme weather events more frequent. Meanwhile population growth is pushing more people into marginal land vulnerable to storm surges, landslides and flooding. The inevitable result is that more natural disasters are affecting more people and more land. As a consequence humanitarian relief agencies are responding to more, and bigger, natural disasters than ever before. It is widely acknowledged that determining and redistributing land ownership promptly and equitably after natural disasters is an important step in the transition from short-term humanitarian relief to the long-term reconstruction of livelihoods and communities. However, there is little consistency between the approaches of different humanitarian relief agencies. Some prefer to leave the issue to national governments, while others get deeply involved mapping previous ownership and demarcating new boundaries. In early 2005 some governments in South and Southeast Asia proposed creating coastal buffer zones in which no reconstruction would be permitted. The idea was to move coastal communities to reduce casualties in the event of a future tsunami. The Sri Lankan government, for example, wanted to establish a restricted area of between 100-300m from the coastline. This would have required the relocation of over 118,000 houses and ran the risk of increasing tensions between resettled and existing communities. The plan was eventually shelved due to local protest."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Clearly defined and equitable land rights may help to improve planning in areas vulnerable to natural disasters. They can encourage landowners to invest in windbreaks, better home construction and flood barriers, and provide the necessary collateral to make such investments. After all, people are much more likely to invest in their land if they are confident those investments will remain with them and that they can pass them on to their children. Likewise, personal or collective ownership may help to reduce the environmental degradation that increases vulnerability to natural disaster. On the other hand insecure, inequitable and opaque land tenure systems lead many to live in marginal, hazard-prone areas without the infrastructure required to withstand the natural threats dictated by geography and climate. The marginal lands typically settled by lowincome communities are rarely surveyed and integrated into disaster risk assessments. For example, much of the damage caused by the cyclone that hit India’s Orissa coast in 1999 occurred in the extensively-deforested new settlement areas along the region’s shoreline, as the storm surge ripped through a 100-km long denuded stretch, killing thousands within minutes. According to local reports, illegal Bangladeshi immigrants had been encouraged to settle in the affected area by vote-seeking politicians. During the construction of their homes, they destroyed sand dunes, mangrove and casuarina forests, stripping away traditional barriers to storm surges and high winds. "
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"In 1977 the island of Divi Seema in the Krishna River delta of India was hit by a strong cyclone which left 10,000 dead. The vulnerability of the victims can largely be attributed to the patterns of land ownership, resource access and rights of the island’s inhabitants. In the years leading up to the cyclone, the majority of the island was controlled by rich landowners who, following the irrigation of the island’s arable inland, bought up the land as absentee landlords. This pushed the marginalized and poor inhabitants from the interior to the coast. In turn the influx of inhabitants to the coast led to increased fishing activities and the destruction of important mangrove buffer areas. Recognizing the problem, the government drew up a plan to transfer large tracts of land to these poor communities. However, the plan was never realized as funding fell short when the beneficiaries could not obtain credit from the banks for land development due to a lack of collateral resources. With banks continuing to lend only to those with collateral, the poor were forced to use moneylenders, which further indebted them through their exorbitant interest rates. Economically and physically vulnerable, these poor communities had few defences against the cyclone when it struck. Several respondents noted that people without secure land ownership often refuse to move away from their land or houses for fear they could lose these assets while in a refugee camp. This was the case after both the 2003 Bam and 2005 Kashmir earthquakes. In Northern Pakistan, an estimated 70,000 people stayed in their devastated and remote mountain villages to protect their property until the winter snow made the areas nearly impassable before descending to the winter refugee camps."
PROPERTY_DAMAGE,"Managers of refugee camps also need to be informed of local land ownership and traditional mechanisms for resolving disputes. In relief camps, for example, assigning individual private lots to groups accustomed to communally-held property rights can be very problematic. Additionally, locating camps on private land can alienate the local population and heighten the demand for locally scarce resources. Finally, there is the danger that the displacement of large numbers of people without clearly defined land ownership can enable private and government ‘land grabs’. Ossie Fernandes of the Chennai-based Human Rights Advocacy and Research Foundation reported after the Asian tsunami that, “there is a very real threat that people are trying to take over land re-zoned as buffer zones. They fear that the Tamil Nadu government, in collaboration with multilateral agencies, is using the disaster to plan to redevelop the area in favour of tourism”. Recovering and protecting communal and private property rights can lay a solid foundation for reconstruction, spatial planning, compensation and long-term economic regeneration. As Bill Clinton noted after the Asian tsunami, “I can think of nothing that will generate more income over the long run for average families in this region than actually having title to the land they own”. Natural disasters tend to cause large population movements. The influx of relocated families—by circumstance, choice or government decree—to previously settled areas naturally increases the local demand for resources. It can also lead to tension and discrimination. In India after the tsunami, there was real concern about a potential outbreak of violence between fisherman and Dalits (untouchable caste) who suddenly became neighbours. The Dalit communities feared that these resettled fishing communities would not want to live close to them and would use their greater political clout to push them out of the region.  "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"The destructive effects of natural disasters are felt more in poorer countries than in more prosperous ones. While both rich and poor nations are subject to natural hazards, most of the 3.3 million disaster-related deaths over the last 40 years occurred in poor countries. For instance, the magnitude 7.0 earthquake in Haiti in 2010 resulted in an estimated 140,000 deaths and ruinous economic losses, while the magnitude 9.1 earthquake in Chile in the same year killed 500 people and had a relatively small negative impact on the national economy. The economic damage caused by disasters varies. Capital assets and infrastructure such as housing, schools, factories and equipment, roads, dams and bridges are lost. Human capital is depleted due to the loss of life, the loss of skilled workers and the destruction of education infrastructure that disrupts schooling. A country’s natural resources may also be affected—hurricanes destroy forests, hurricanes and droughts decrease soil fertility. Recurrent natural disasters can result in “adaptive behaviour” by individuals and communities that brings on further economic loss. Farmers may invest less to increase productivity of their land in drought-prone areas for fear of their investment being lost. he scale of these catastrophes makes it impossibly difficult to cope and recover in their aftermath. Survivors and affected communities are left reeling from the loss of lives and livelihoods. Nations and Governments confront the giant task of restoring and rebuilding destroyed assets—both economic and social. But clarity in our understanding of the challenges of post-disaster economic development is imperative. Globally, our exposure to the perils of these events is likely to increase in the future. Climate change is predicted to intensify the severity of extreme weather events. In addition, the number of us living in hazard-prone contexts will only increase as we move to cities that have inadequate disaster prevention or to geographical areas (flood plains, steep hillsides) that are especially vulnerable to hazards."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"The poor are the hardest hit by natural disasters. Mortality rates are typically highest among those with the lowest incomes. They are more likely to live in hazard-prone areas or to have fragile housing. When Cyclone Nargis struck the Irrawaddy Delta in Myanmar in 2008, one in two families had their homes completely destroyed by wind and flooding. In Haiti, mortality from the earthquake of 2010 was highest among the urban poor of Port-au-Prince, who lived in poorly constructed, crowded housing. The poor also suffer disproportionately from the loss of economic assets. Natural disasters destroy farms, livestock, workshops and equipment. Families may be forced to sell off assets to meet basic needs—rural families in drought-stricken regions often sell cattle to purchase food. Because the poor are less able to replace these income-providing assets, they may fall into long-term “poverty traps”, from which they would be unable to emerge. Evidence from around the world—from the Philippines to Ethiopia to Colombia—shows that poverty rates among disaster-affected communities often increase. These economic shocks experienced by the poor can have harmful effects that span generations. School enrolment may fall as parents pull children out of school to help boost family income. Even if this is intended to be temporary, it can become permanent, as it did during the droughts in Central Mexico in the late 1990s. When droughts and food deficits cause malnutrition in young children, cognitive ability and potential productivity suffers in later years. In Tanzania and Zimbabwe, children malnourished during droughts have lower lifetime earnings. Natural disasters shatter lives. I know. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami shattered mine. They also wreck communities and, sometimes, even entire countries. Sudden cataclysmic disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and floods cause devastation on impact. Slow-onset disasters such as droughts inflict persistent damage over time."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Devising and implementing policy and action for economic recovery in the wake of a natural disaster is messy and complicated. Destroyed assets need to be rebuilt and replaced. Lost livelihoods must be revived or new ones created. Swift and effective measures are needed, both to sustain economic growth and general welfare in disaster-struck countries, and to ease the suffering of individuals and communities directly affected by these terrible events. There is no universal blueprint for recovery—for individuals, communities or nations. The process of economic rebuilding is unique to each country that is affected by a natural disaster. There are challenges and difficulties that are common to most countries, however, and understanding them is important if policies and actions are to reduce the human suffering that occurs when disasters strike. The speed of recovery matters. This is especially true in developing countries where livelihoods are precarious even in the absence of a disaster. When post-disaster reconstruction is slow, the economic pain and deprivation of families and communities is deep and long-lasting. Studies done five years after Cyclone Nargis made landfall in Myanmar revealed that more than half of the surviving households had still not been able to replace fishing boats and livestock taken by the storm surge. The quality of economic recovery also matters. Natural disasters are often seen as providing a chance to “build back better”—better housing, roads, schools and hospitals. It is important, however, to clarify what we mean by “better”. Rebuilding housing and public infrastructure to higher standards of safety that reduce disaster risk is vital. It minimizes human and economic losses in future events and helps soften the fear and trauma of survivors as they re-emerge into social and economic life. The tragically high level of fatalities among school children in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China was partly due to poor compliance with building codes, and ensuring safety standards was the key focus of recovery."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Building back better is sometimes seen as an opportunity for a disaster-struck country to make a “developmental leap” by creating, for instance, sophisticated infrastructure that would not have existed in the absence of the disaster. If this is not done in a way that matches the availability of local capabilities, however, recovery will falter. So “building back adequately” could be what is most needed for ravaged economies. Even this is hugely difficult for poor countries that are depleted of human capital when large disasters strike. The earthquake in Haiti in 2010 robbed the country of skills and ingenuities needed to absorb sophisticated reconstruction. “Better rebuilding” must also be culturally consistent. The instances of new, hazard-resistant housing remaining unoccupied due to unfamiliar or unsuitable design are numerous. In Sri Lanka, I have seen entire housing projects used as storehouses for rice because the local communities thought the tsunami-resistant, circular shapes of these dwellings too strange to live in. Who wins and who loses from post-disaster economic recovery? This is an important question to ask because the beneficiaries may not always be those with the greatest economic losses. In the aftermath of disaster, Governments and donors assess damages and losses and draw up technical proposals for reconstruction. The outcomes of these plans, however, can often diverge from their intentions. In practice, a host of other factors come into play, including the availability of funds and skills, the quality of implementing institutions, vested interests and power relations. Sometimes vulnerable groups with legally insecure land rights (women, sharecroppers, tenant farmers and urban squatters) suffer heavily from the loss of lives and incomes during a disaster, and then lose even more when resettlement plans do not recognize their customary ownership rights or when economically powerful groups engage in land grabs. So, new or altered social and economic inequalities can emerge even as economic recovery at a broader, national level takes place."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Even after post-disaster rebuilding, old patterns of vulnerability and deprivation can persist. This happens even in rich countries. Ten years after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, United States, child poverty rates in the State of Louisiana remained strikingly high. Such cases highlight the need to rethink the concept of “building back better”; it must encompass not merely infrastructure but also a more inclusive trajectory of economic development. Economic rebuilding after a disaster never completely recovers what was lost and does not return communities to a “normal” state that existed before. There is often a “new normal”, as societies and economies are forever altered. Effective economic reconstruction in this new normal can ease the suffering of individuals and communities and can boost economic growth and welfare in the future. But we must be alert to the difficulties and potential pitfalls of rebuilding. Policy and action by countries and donors should not exacerbate the trauma and tragedy of natural disasters. A disaster can cause issues in mental health and well-being along with interruption of economic as well as social development at a global level. The disasters cause societal disruptions not just through the singular event, but many other incidents after the event might disrupt the social structure. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Trauma and grief will put personal, family and community relationships under pressure. The mental health impacts of disasters can lead to an increase in problematic alcohol and drug use, self-harm, violence and abuse – which may well act as early warning signs. Capital assets and infrastructure such as housing, schools, factories and equipment, roads, dams and bridges are lost. Human capital is depleted due to the loss of life, the loss of skilled workers and the destruction of education infrastructure that disrupts schooling. Altogether, these calamities have cost the economy dearly in terms of lost wages and output, utility disruptions, destruction of public and private property, additional commuter time and transportation costs and hundreds of lives. The comparison of impacts in two countries in the Pacific Rim are telling: Despite similar patterns of natural disasters in Peru and in Japan, fatalities average 2,900 in Peru but just 63 in Japan. Poverty in the developing portion of the Pacific Rim region is already staggering. For example, out of the 1.2 billion persons in the developing world that live on less than $1 dollar a day, 43.5% live in South Asia and 23.2% live in East Asia and the Pacific (World Bank, 2000). "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Economic and social development throughout the world is frequently interrupted by extreme events. The Pacific Rim is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, thus to social and economic losses. Although disaster events impact both developed and developing countries, in the latter, they can cause a sharp increase in poverty. As disasters pose an important challenge to the development of the Pacific Rim, it is important to assess their global, regional, economic, and social impacts. Most economic assessments of the impacts of disasters have concentrated on direct losses—that is, the financial cost of physical damage. Equally important are indirect and secondary impacts of disasters, including the destruction of communities and their negative impacts on families. The challenges posed by potential disasters in the Pacific Rim countries require rapid action, and also an energetic risk-management strategy. To help reduce those negative impacts, countries need an overall evaluation of their risks, including: (i) risk identification, (ii) risk reduction, and (iii) risk transfer. It is expected that concerted action on risk management will help create an increased awareness of the economy—wide significance of natural disasters and the problems they pose for long—term development. Accordingly, this growing awareness will lead to an increased resilience in the countries of the Pacific Rim."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Although disaster events impact both developed and developing countries, the latter suffer more the burden of disasters, inasmuch as disasters and poverty are closely linked: they can be the result of poverty and can also cause a sharp increase in scarcity. Between 1990 and 1998, more than 97 percent of all natural disaster-related deaths were in developing countries. In 1999, natural and manmade disasters are estimated to have claimed more than 105,000 lives across the globe and resulted in losses on the order of $100 billion. The vast majority of those disasters have taken place in emerging economies and in vulnerable communities that are the least able to deal with the social and economic devastation that these events bring in their wake. The beginning of the year 2001 was marked by major extreme events worldwide, such as the earthquakes in El Salvador and in India, the floods in Mozambique, and the earthquake in Seattle. Average losses from disasters as a proportion of GDP are 20 percent higher in developing countries than in industrial economies. The comparison of impacts in two countries in the Pacific Rim are telling: Despite similar patterns of natural disasters in Peru and in Japan, fatalities average 2,900 in Peru but just 63 in Japan. Poverty in the developing portion of the Pacific Rim region is already staggering. For example, out of the 1.2 billion persons in the developing world that live on less than $1 dollar a day, 43.5% live in South Asia and 23.2% live in East Asia and the Pacific. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Most economic assessments of disaster impacts have concentrated on direct losses in the specific country affected—that is, on the financial cost of physical damage. However, the negative impacts of natural disasters have not only immediate implications but also longer-term effects. In Asia, for example, where 70 % of the world's floods occur, the average annual cost of floods over the past decade was estimated at $15 billion, with infrastructure losses accounting for 65 %. The need to replace damaged infrastructure in disaster-stricken countries diverts government resources from longer-term development objectives and consumes a significant share of multinational lending resources. Indirect, secondary, regional, and micro-level impacts can also be severe. The indirect and secondary impacts could include, for example, effects on the flow of goods and services, changes in income distribution, on the incidence of poverty in a region, as well as on balance of payments and budgets. The earthquake in Gujarat, India had a significant impact on the fiscal deficit of that country. It is estimated that the deterioration in the fiscal balance will be the result mostly of increased expenditure pressures related to relief, reconstruction of public assets, and assistance to reconstruction of private assets. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"The earthquake in Gujarat also illustrates the importance of impacts at the micro level. Although the earthquake will not have a major impact at the national level, it has destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives and livelihoods. A large number of families have suffered the death or serious disability of a member, and thus the event will have long-term consequences on the well-being of other members, particularl y widows, single-paren t children , orphans, and the elderly. Disasters pose an important challenge to the development of the Pacific Rim; thus, it is important to assess their economic and social impacts at the regional, global, and micro-levels. Regional impacts include, for example, disruptions in trade, travel, and migration of people. Examples of regional disruption include the case of Hurricane Mitch in Central America, which affected several countries and disrupted transportation and trade between countries in the region. The forest fires in Indonesia in 1997 and the transboundary haze resulting from the fires affected several neighboring countries for a period of about four months, and had a significant impact on health, daily life, transportation, and air traffic. At a smaller scale, the earthquake in Seattle also had a regional impact. It damaged the Seattle-Tacoma international airport, forcing the airport's immediate closure, thus disrupting air traffic in this important hub. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"There is a critical difference between the experience in the developing world and that in developed countries with respect to coping with disasters. This difference involves not simply the disparity in lives lost. In the developed countries, efforts are made to reduce losses and to repair damage, while their economies continue to grow. In addition, highly efficient and effective banking systems, insurance arrangements, the private sector, and taxpayers all can play a role in promoting rapid recover)' and providing incentives for reducing catastrophic losses. After the earthquake that impacted the Seattle area on February 29, 2001, the authorities noted that one reason there was not a greater destruction and a higher number of injuries was that the region spent millions of dollars in the last decade retrofitting buildings and schools, buttressing bridges and viaducts, and bolting homes to their foundations. The earthquakes that impacted El Salvador on January 13, 2001 (and again on February 13, 2001) and the Gujarat area in India on January 26, 2001 show a sharp contrast with the situation in Seattle. In Gujarat, the death toll was vast, about 19,000 lives were lost, entire villages were reduced to rubble, and critical infrastructure (schools, hospitals, roads, and homes) was destroyed. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Major destruction also occurred in El Salvador. An assessment of damage conducted by the Economic Commission on Latin America (ECLAC, 2001) indicates that the magnitude of the earthquake , when added to pre-existing vulnerabilities, is such that the country's potential for economic growth and development will be jeopardized in the short and medium term. The emergency and reconstruction needs exceed capacity of national and local authorities to provide them. Although all three areas (Seattle, El Salvador, and Gujarat) have a history of earthquakes, building codes, their enforcement, the location of population in high-risk areas, and the growth of urban population in unsafe locations has proceeded differently. The Washington Post (March 2, 2001) noted that the relatively mild consequences of the earthquake in Seattle points to the growing gap between rich and poor nations in their ability to mitigate the effects of natural disasters. Vulnerability, risk, and powerlessness are very real dimensions of poverty, whether they manifest themselves in economic shocks or in the natural disasters that disproportionately affect countries in the developing world. The World Development Report makes clear that the economic impacts of natural disasters are one of the factors that conspire to create and perpetuate poverty. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"What specific mechanisms are available to help countries and communities in the Pacific Rim, as well as in other regions, reduce their vulnerability and their losses from natural disasters? An integrated risk-management strategy is key to ensuring that ongoing development is not disrupted by a disaster. Formulating such a strategy involves identifying the risks the country faces, mitigating the damage caused by those risks, and transferring the risk to other parties if possible. Formulation of an effective risk-management strategy must begin with the identification of risk. Countries must identify the principal hazards they face and assess the vulnerability of principal settled areas, infrastructure, and economic assets. The analysis typically should include estimates of the direct, indirect, and secondary impacts of disasters. The damage caused by disasters can be reduced by changing perceptions and behavior so that all members of a society place a high priority on safety in planning and development. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"All stakeholders must contribute to the creation of a culture of safety. Standards for public works, retrofitting of schools and hospitals, and their certification in terms of construction and readiness to withstand shocks should be implemented. Strategies for improving education about disaster mitigation include creating incentives and adopting regulations that will encourage individuals and businesses to reduce the risks they face and promote a culture of social protection. Active programs of targeted professional education and broad public awareness of disaster risk and mitigation should be developed. Programs should include dissemination of information on natural disaster risk and mitigation, the inclusion of disaster preparedness and mitigation materials in elementary and high school curricula, and special programs targeting low-income communities that are the most severely impacted by disasters. The regulatory approach to encouraging disaster prevention and mitigation requires a comprehensive reassessment of the formal land use and building regulatory processes. New approaches to land use management and building quality management must by developed that effectively contribute to public safety in the informal sector. Most mitigation decisions are made at the community level. Thus, resources must be allocated to increase the capacity and authority for risk management and disaster mitigation at the state and community levels. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Generating income for poor communities is essential, and relies upon the ability to encourage the productive units in the economy to explore the role of both individuals and private enterprise, and on the economic and social forces that lift people out of poverty. An important place to start is at the community level, where microlevel financial institutions are able to foster small-scale businesses that help stimulate economic growth and raise the living standards of poor households. Social funds are a new social mechanism that has been developed by international financial institutions to deliver assistance to the poor. Social funds focus investments on community organizations and on the construction and rehabilitation of small public works such as water supply and public health care delivery facilities. When resources are available, these investments can expand rapidly because they do not implement projects directly but through intermediaries such as private construction firms and NGOs. According to Siri, social funds are potentially efficient mechanisms for promoting disaster prevention, mitigation, and response. Among the techniques Siri proposes to mitigate the risks that the poor face is the establishment of ""best-practice"" standards in infrastructure construction programs by incorporating project designs aimed at reducing potential damage from future disasters. Other mechanisms include: setting an example by not rebuilding in risk-prone zones that have been ravaged by previous disasters, including, among the social funds, investment programs in damage-mitigation projects such as flood control, reforestation, and droughtmitigation infrastructure; and making available microlevel financing to promote the functioning of small enterprises. An important challenge in financing capital investments is to provide a more secure environment for those investments and to give vulnerable communities access to insurance plans that can help them manage the risks of natural hazards that they confront. Insurance plans that assist in the transfer of risks from the few to the many is an essential component of a disaster risk strategy. But insurance also stimulates valuable loss-control measures, such as the enforcement of building codes, and provides incentives for investments in mitigation. These are services that many developing countries have little capacity to provide, but are the stock-in-trade of an experienced private sector. An important challenge is to combine local knowledge and expertise with private-sector innovation and know-how. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"This paper analyses the socio-economic effects of hurricane Mitch using a gender approach and proposes new analysis indicators for crisis situations that may better reflect women’s disadvantageous position relative to men. The first section of the document discusses key concepts used in gender and disaster analysis, in the context of the region and hurricane Mitch. The following section examines the direct and indirect impacts, and looks at how they have affected women, as well as the responses to Mitch at three levels: first, that of individuals and their strategies for coping with the crisis; second, the actions of governments and the coordinated bodies of civil society; and third, reconstruction initiatives carried out by national and international organizations. The final section attempts to draw together the salient points and challenges suggested by the analysis. It also offers some recommendations for integrating this approach into future emergency and reconstruction scenarios and for reducing women’s current vulnerability. As it moved northward, hurricane Mitch brought higher-than-usual rainfall, floods and high tides on the Salvadoran coast. The hurricane had a major impact on the Gulf of Fonseca, the Bajo Lempa Valley and the departments of La Unión and San Miguel, particularly in the Chilanguera River, which was where the majority of deaths in El Salvador occurred. It is estimated that the hurricane had a direct impact on one out of 10 people in the region and caused damage totalling US$ 4 billion to the productive sector, including two thirds of the infrastructure of Honduras and Nicaragua; US$ 1,2 billion in total physical infrastructure in the region; US$ 800 million in housing, health and education; and US$ 3 billion in raw materials and plantations (ECA 2000)."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Disasters such as Hurricane Mitch are natural phenomena, but their impacts are not. Rather, their effects are the result of the actions of human beings and are determined by the circumstances of the country in question, i.e., poverty, social inequalities, and the extent of deforestation, among other factors. Blaikie et al. (1994:3) point out that there is a risk inherent in treating disasters as something peculiar or as events detached from people’s daily lives. In the countries of Central America, this serves as a warning against analyses that separate natural disasters from their political and socio-economic context, from economic growth in line with the neoliberal model, and from the vulnerabilities inherent in this process, which affect the impact of a hurricane such as Mitch. Moreover, where disasters take place in societies governed by power relations based on gender, age or social class, their impact will also reflect these relations and, as a result, people’s experience of the disaster will vary. Today, the importance of the gender perspective during times of crisis and emergency is acknowledged, both on account of the differentiated impact on men and women and on account of the different strategies adopted by them to deal with such situations (Byrne, 1995; CAW, 1998). Despite the recent activities and publications of a small group of experts on disasters (Enarson and Morrow, 1998; Peacock et al., 1997), a gender perspective has not become mainstream within disasters research. Moreover, although a number of gender training manuals and guides have been made available, often the so called ‘tyranny of the urgent’ wins out over good practice. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"This study aims to study how disaster losses are affected by unemployment and poverty, then how disasters also cause income inequality in Indonesia and the causal relationship between disaster losses and income inequality. To determine the structural relationship between economic variables and disaster losses, the Structural Equation Model-Partial Least Squares (SEM - PLS) approach is used. This approach is an approach previously not found in economic and environmental studies. This study uses secondary data consisting of 30 years 1990–2019 collected from the territory of Indonesia. The results of the study found that unemployment and poverty variables had a significant effect on the disaster loss variable. The disaster loss variable has a significant effect on the income inequality variable. The income inequality variable has no effect on the disaster loss variable. Research is expected to contribute to the study of the impact of economic development and the environment. The study of whether natural disasters are a real obstacle to the growth and economic development of a country is a study that is being carried out by many experts, considering that natural disasters are unpredictable events but have a real impact on the economy. A disaster in an area will have an impact on economic losses, among others, in the form of infrastructure damage in the area where the disaster occurred (Hidalgo and Baez, 2019). Studies on disasters conducted by many experts have found that disasters with the category of disasters that occur suddenly (hurricanes, earthquakes, floods) will damage productive capital and infrastructure. Different things happen to disasters categorized as disasters that occur slowly (drought and floods) where these disasters have a wider and long-term impact."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"Climate change and its impacts are of concern to researchers in economics and environmental economics today. Because they are increasingly aware of the significant impacts of disasters and climate change on human and economic development. Furthermore, it is also suspected that the disaster losses that occur will also have an impact on the level of income distribution and poverty (Groeschl, 2020). The same condition is supported by the results of research conducted in Pakistan that unemployment and poverty have a significant relationship with disasters and income inequality. This study also proves the occurrence of the EKC hypothesis in the study area (Hassan et al., 2015). Recommendations in environmental economics studies state that fighting reduced production and rising unemployment targets low-carbon investment, will be able to create up to 5 million 'green collar' jobs and revive the economy (Dietz and Maddison, 2009). This proves that the green economy can reduce unemployment. Poor unemployment will result in high income inequality as well, this relationship is exacerbated by disasters. Studies that examine the effect of unemployment on disasters are still quite difficult to find, where most studies are still on the impact of disasters on economic variables, not the other way around."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION," further impact of the disaster-economic relationship, namely the relationship between environmental damage, natural disasters and income inequality, has been described by (Kuznets, 1955). In the long-term study model of economic variables and climate change, it is found that climate change also has a significant effect on the distribution of opinions and the same is explained by (Piontek et al., 2019). This was also found by (Peter and Aung, Lwin, 2018) and (Hassan et al., 2015), who stated that the disaster increased economic inequality in the affected areas. Economic conditions in developing countries that are less stable and good make developing countries very vulnerable to the effects of climate change which in the end, if not properly anticipated by these countries, will lead to a disaster. However, most developing countries are often unable to implement sound adaptation strategies to reduce the negative impacts of climate change (Al-Amin et al., 2019). Disasters due to climate change create a food crisis problem in which developing countries are very vulnerable to this, due to the lack of technology in these countries. In a study conducted by (Tseliosa and Tompkins, 2018), it was found that the relationship between the total impact of disasters and income resembles an inverted 'U' letter. "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION," A disaster that occurs in a country will cause a decrease in productivity, which in turn will cause a decline in economic growth in that country. In fact, the study conducted found that flooding reduced the GDP growth rate per capita by 0.005% for every thousands of every million people affected. Then the disaster that occurs will have an irreversible impact on people's livelihoods (Shabnam, 2014). The findings of disaster research in Japan reinforce the impact of losses due to disasters, where in this study it is found that disasters will significantly damage the agricultural production sector, fisheries and loss of capital stock in the manufacturing industry. Then the disaster will cause a problem of considerable economic loss (Okiyama, 2017). Then the disaster will ultimately lead to a higher level of income inequality. The same is the case with the snow disaster that occurred in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau which caused serious losses to the livelihoods of the rural population. In more detail, it is also found that this condition occurs due to losses in the form of loss and damage to financial capital, physical capital, human capital, social capital and natural capital. Furthermore, evidence pertaining to the long-term effects of natural disasters on individual victims remains limited to a handful of studies of specific disasters in the US. Long-term impacts could be quite different in poor countries because of lower incomes, less robust social safety nets, and other differences. Similarly, more evidence is needed to understand the health impacts of natural disasters, especially when it comes to long-term outcomes and poor countries. Expanding and improving longitudinal data collection (including administrative data) and facilitating researcher access to such data are essential for filling in these gaps."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION," Disasters that have an impact on worsening conditions of poverty and inequality were also found in the Vietnam study (Priaga, 2008) and (Bui et al., 2014). Disasters that occur will not only cause economic losses in the form of increased poverty but also change the socio-economic characteristics of the community affected by the disaster (Priaga, 2008) and (Bui et al., 2014). So that disasters can be understood to lead to higher income inequality and the level of welfare. The same thing was found in research conducted in Vietnam which found that the losses incurred were in the form of poverty and inequality of expenditure. Thus, disaster studies are something that must be considered in making economic development policies in the form of reducing poverty and equalization of income. Indonesia as a region with a disaster-prone topography is exacerbated by the risk of climate change. As a result, routine natural disasters such as flash floods and landslides have become a serious threat to various regions in Indonesia. The Indonesian region experienced more than 1,800 disasters in 2005–2015. Types of hydrometeorological disasters are closely related to human involvement in the use of natural resources. Meanwhile, geological disasters are earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. Climate change is increasing the impact of disasters that occur from hydrometeorological disasters. The high frequency of hydrometeorological disasters will have an even bigger impact on the economic sector of the community "
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION," Therefore, the causes and consequences of disasters must be considered as factors in designing policies to achieve development goals. However, from the literature review conducted, it can be concluded that studies that attempt to examine how disasters are both cause and effect variables of economic variables in structural relationships have not been found, especially for studies in Indonesia which are disaster-prone countries and economically have relatively unstable economic indicators. Existing literature review still looks at the relationship between the influence of the variable disaster partially, there is no study that tries to conduct a study with a structural variable relationship model. While economic variables are systemic variables, the impact on a variable will have an impact on other variables, and even this impact can be a causal relationship. So this research tries to answer the gaps in the study, so it is hoped that it will be known how unemployment and poverty affect disasters. Then how will this disaster strengthen the level of income inequality that occurs in the community and vice versa, how does the inequality affect the level of disaster losses. This model study uses a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach which has never been found in economic and environmental studies using the SEM approach. In general, economic and environmental literature uses a regression approach, it is hoped that this approach will become a new approach that will answer structural problems in economic and environmental problems."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION," Adequate studies on disasters and socio-economic indicators have been carried out, but there is a lack of research on how the disaster loss variable is able to mediate the effect of macroeconomic indicator variables on other macroeconomic variables. So, this study aims to fill the gap in existing environmental economics research. The model in this study is an extension of the green Solow model. This study wanted to determine the effect of unemployment and poverty variables on income inequality through the intervening variable of economic losses due to disasters. From this model it can also be seen how unemployment and poverty affect each other. The analysis approach is carried out using a structural equation modeling (SEM) model. This approach is a new way of studying that includes the disaster loss variable as the intervening variable of unemployment and poverty. This study aims to build a model of the influence of macroeconomics on other macroeconomics mediated by economic losses due to disasters. This model is expected to be the basis for developing a theory of the impact of disasters on the economic condition of the community. At the application level, this model is expected to be an evaluation model to see the effectiveness of disaster management and formulate strategic policies for communities affected by disasters. Relatedly, little is known about the returns from ex-ante mitigation spending. While not all impacts of natural disasters can be avoided, sea walls, natural flood management, zoning and building regulations, and other policies aimed at reducing the impact of an extreme event could be cost-effective ways of reducing the negative consequences of natural disasters. Yet not all mitigation measures are likely to be cost-effective, and their cost-effectiveness may depend on the characteristics of a given protected area (consider the contrast between protecting New York City and a sparsely populated rural area). More research along these dimensions would be welcome."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION," The study of economic and environmental growth models has been developed by Solow in the economic growth model. This model is built with the assumption that each production process also has negative externalities due to environmental damage that occurs during the production process carried out in economic development. This condition results in part of the production output must also be allocated for environmental improvement, so that not all resources or inputs can be allocated for production, this causes a decrease in economic growth. The disaster that occurs has a strong relationship with the economic conditions of the affected community. Disasters have a negative impact on people's incomes and decrease the level of macroeconomic indicators (Vale and Campanella, 2005). The severity of the economic impact experienced by the community will be determined by the economic condition of the community before a disaster occurs (Songwathana, 2018). The damage to productive capacity that occurs as a result of a disaster will of course have a negative impact on regional economic growth, employment, poverty and income distribution. Poor households have low disaster preparedness. The poor who live in disaster-prone areas with income derived from the traditional agricultural sector which depends on the weather result in the poor people experiencing higher income losses. This condition will result in higher levels of poverty and income inequality."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION," Environmental damage is a result of the socio-economic conditions of the community. It was found that the level of disaster losses that occurred was related to the social and economic conditions of the community, the better the socio-economic conditions of the community the lower the level of economic losses that occurred (C.E Haque, 2003) the same thing is also confirmed by the findings (Padli et al., 2018). The same study also found that (Izevbuwa and Adeolu, 2015), stated that half of the population of Nigerians who experienced floods had lost up to 79% of their main income and what was worse were farmers who had lost all their income, while they only received compensation from government about 13% of all losses. As a result of the flood disaster, there was a very significant reduction in the rate of economic growth and of course in the end it led to income inequality.Economic and social development throughout the world is frequently interrupted by extreme events. The Pacific Rim is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, thus to social and economic losses. Although disaster events impact both developed and developing countries, in the latter, they can cause a sharp increase in poverty. To date, no studies of the economic effects of natural disasters have successfully separated the effects of natural disasters from the countervailing effects of natural disaster aid and other transfers to disaster victims. As a result, the extent to which such aid is helpful in staving off the adverse health or economic effects of disasters is unknown. This shortcoming is significant because it means that researchers cannot calculate the benefits of increasing aid to victims."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION," As disasters pose an important challenge to the development of the Pacific Rim, it is important to assess their global, regional, economic, and social impacts. Most economic assessments of the impacts of disasters have concentrated on direct losses—that is, the financial cost of physical damage. Equally important are indirect and secondary impacts of disasters, including the destruction of communities and their negative impacts on families. The challenges posed by potential disasters in the Pacific Rim countries require rapid action, and also an energetic risk-management strategy. To help reduce those negative impacts, countries need an overall evaluation of their risks, including: (i) risk identification, (ii) risk reduction, and (iii) risk transfer. It is expected that concerted action on risk management will help create an increased awareness of the economy—wide significance of natural disasters and the problems they pose for long—term development. Accordingly, this growing awareness will lead to an increased resilience in the countries of the Pacific Rim. Extreme events are significant determinants of the character and evolution of many natural and human systems. When extreme events occur at the interface between natural and human systems, they are often called “disasters.” Here, we use a systemic, contextual view of disasters to construct a framework for organizing research and policy. Within this framework, reduction of vulnerability is the organizing principle, and decision processes (which lead to reduced vulnerability) are the fundamental unit of analysis and action. Scientific research is connected to decision processes through knowledge—integrating activities such as prediction, observation, and heuristics. But the value of research depends on its capacity to enhance decision-making capabilities. Our goal is to define an approach by which policy—relevant research questions can be more readily recognized. and societally valuable (i.e., vulnerabilityreducing) knowledge can be more effectively created and used."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION," Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity, threatening lives and livelihoods around the world. Understanding the short- and long-term effects of such events is necessary for crafting optimal policy. The short-term economic impacts of natural disasters can be severe, suggesting that policies that better insure against consumption losses during this time would be beneficial. Longer-term economic impacts are more complex and depend on the characteristics of the affected population and the affected area, changes in migration patterns, and public policy. The economic impact of a natural disaster does not end with physical damage and loss of life. Natural disasters can also affect victims’ employment, health, and migration decisions, with potentially significant long-term repercussions. Well-designed policy can limit such impacts cost-effectively, and there are many policy options available to policymakers, including protective infrastructure, better land-use policy, monetary incentives to reduce risk, and ex-post relief. Understanding the magnitude of and mechanisms behind the short- and long-term effects of natural disasters is an essential first step toward crafting optimal public policy. The study also finds that households reacted to the typhoon by creating long-distance migrants; the typhoon increased the probability that at least one long-distance migrant would leave any given household by 17%. These so-called “ex-post” migrants earned 25–35% lower incomes than those who had migrated before the typhoon, however, despite similarities in other observable characteristics. This difference is likely due to a combination of worse job–worker matches and shorter job tenures among ex-post migrants."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION," A natural disaster can also change the local labor market equilibrium. The effect of a disaster on labor supply and demand—and therefore on wages—is ambiguous. A natural disaster can reduce the labor supply if it kills prime-age individuals or causes mass out-migration from an affected area. It is also possible, though, for a natural disaster to increase the labor supply through the so-called income effect: individuals whose assets are destroyed may decide to supply more labor—that is, work longer hours or multiple jobs—to replace the assets. The demand for rebuilding could both attract new workers to an area and raise wages. Labor demand can weaken, though, if a disaster causes a net reduction in demand for goods and services, which then translates into reduced demand for the labor needed to create those goods and services. For example, if tourism to a disaster-affected area falls, demand for labor in the hospitality sector is likely to fall as well. Labor demand in some sectors, though, such as construction, is likely to increase. Nearly every sub-national empirical study of natural disasters finds short-term declines in either income or employment. A study of major hurricane strikes in US coastal counties finds that hurricanes cause county-level personal income growth to fall by 0.45 percentage points in the year of the impact, which represents over 25% of the mean growth rate [1]. Much of this effect is due to a compositional change in the population, as richer individuals respond to the shock by moving out and poorer individuals move in. At the state level, the economic effects of a hurricane net out to zero over a given year, and past hurricanes have no significant effects on current growth. Another county-level study of US hurricanes detects no drop in per capita wage/salary levels but does find temporary decreases in the employment rate beginning a few years after a hurricane. The study also finds that transfers through standing social safety net programs increase to a greater extent than transfers through dedicated disaster aid programs, potentially offsetting some negative employment and income effects that would have materialized otherwise. Thus, it is not just disaster-specific policy that can matter for recovery but other, more general, safety nets as well."
SOCIAL_AND_ECONOMIC_DISTRUPTION,"A global study of 53 major floods, each of which displaced at least 100,000 people and affected primarily poor countries, finds that the floods reduced contemporaneous economic activity in cities, as proxied by satellite-detected night light intensity . Yet economic activity was disrupted only briefly, returning to normal levels quickly. Low-elevation urban areas—which also experience denser economic activity—flood more frequently but recover just as quickly as higher-elevation areas. The study concludes that, except for recently populated areas, these devastating floods appear not to have caused permanent shifts in economic activity. Many studies that consider incomes and employment also consider migration rates, often finding them to be affected by a disaster. For example, nearly a one-third greater proportion of the population left New Orleans in the year following Hurricane Katrina than in normal years, although more than half of those who left later returned. The study, which spans nearly a century of US disasters, finds that, over the decade in which a county is affected by a severe disaster, the county's net out-migration rate increases by 1.5 percentage points. This evidence is consistent with weaker labor demand that results from falling local productivity, which encourages out-migration. In more recent US history, hurricanes have been shown to increase both out-migration and in-migration at the county level but result in no net population changes,. One study is able to measure migration by income level, estimating that wealthier individuals are more likely to move away following a hurricane strike . The study concludes that more than one-quarter of the estimated income decline can be explained by selective out-migration of higher-income individuals. In poor countries, it appears that some households use temporary migration as a coping strategy in the face of an economic shock. The study of Typhoon Ketsana victims finds that long-distance internal migration was an important channel through which households were able to offset some of the income declines. Net remittances per capita from such migrants increased substantially in response to the typhoon, offsetting about 20% of the income losses on average and about 40% of the income losses among households that contributed at least one long-distance migrant. By contrast, transfers from migrants who left for non-labor reasons, informal transfers from family and friends, and transfers from social assistance programs did not increase significantly in the study's setting.
