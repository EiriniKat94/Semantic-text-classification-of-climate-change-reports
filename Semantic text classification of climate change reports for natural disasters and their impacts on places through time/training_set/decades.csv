1930s,"The 1930s (pronounced ""nineteen-thirties"" and commonly abbreviated as ""the '30s"" or ""the Thirties"") was a decade that began on January 1, 1930, and ended on December 31, 1939. In the United States, the Dust Bowl led to the nickname the ""Dirty Thirties"". The decade was defined by a global economic and political crisis that culminated in the Second World War. It saw the collapse of the international financial system, beginning with the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the largest stock market crash in American history. The subsequent economic downfall, called the Great Depression, had traumatic social effects worldwide, leading to widespread poverty and unemployment, especially in the economic superpower of the United States and in Germany, which was already struggling with the payment of reparations for the First World War. The Dust Bowl in the United States (which led to the nickname the ""Dirty Thirties"") exacerbated the scarcity of wealth. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, elected in 1933, introduced a program of broad-scale social reforms and stimulus plans called the New Deal in response to the crisis. The Soviet's second five-year plan gave heavy industry top priority, putting the Soviet Union not far behind Germany as one of the major steel-producing countries of the world, while also improving communications. First-wave feminism made advances, with women gaining the right to vote in South Africa (1930, whites only), Brazil (1933), and Cuba (1933). Following the rise of Adolf Hitler and the emergence of the NSDAP as the country's sole legal party in 1933, Germany imposed a series of laws which discriminated against Jews and other ethnic minorities."
1930s,"The China floods of 1931 are among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded. The German dirigible airship Hindenburg exploding in 1937. A dust storm approaches Stratford, Texas, in 1935, during the Dust Bowl. The 1935 Labor Day Hurricane makes landfall in the Florida Keys as a Category 5 hurricane and the most intense hurricane to ever make landfall in the Atlantic basin. It caused an estimated $6 million (1935 USD) in damages and killed around 408 people. The hurricane's strong winds and storm surge destroyed nearly all of the structures between Tavernier and Marathon, and the town of Islamorada was obliterated. The German dirigible airship Hindenburg explodes in the sky above Lakehurst, New Jersey, United States on May 6, 1937, killing 36 people. The event leads to an investigation of the explosion and the disaster causes major public distrust of the use of hydrogen-inflated airships and seriously damages the reputation of the Zeppelin company. The New London School in New London, Texas, is destroyed by an explosion, killing in excess of 300 students and teachers (1937). The New England Hurricane of 1938, which became a Category 5 hurricane before making landfall as a Category 3. The hurricane was estimated to have caused property losses of US$306 million ($4.72 billion in 2010), killed between 682 and 800 people, and damaged or destroyed over 57,000 homes, including the home of famed actress Katharine Hepburn, who had been staying in her family's Old Saybrook, Connecticut, beach home when the hurricane struck."
1930s,"The Dust Bowl, or ""Dirty Thirties"", a period of severe dust storms causing major ecological and agricultural damage to American and Canadian prairie lands from 1930 to 1936 (in some areas until 1940). Caused by extreme drought coupled with strong winds and decades of extensive farming without crop rotation, fallow fields, cover crops, or other techniques to prevent erosion, it affected an estimated 100,000,000 acres (400,000 km2) of land (traveling as far east as New York and the Atlantic Ocean), caused mass migration (which was the inspiration for the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck), food shortages, multiple deaths and illness from sand inhalation (see History in Motion), and a severe reduction in the going wage rate. The 1938 Yellow River flood pours out from Huayuankou, China, inundating 54,000 km2 (21,000 sq mi) of land and killing an estimated 500,000 people. The NSDAP (Nazi Party) under Adolf Hitler wins the German federal election, March 1933. Hitler becomes Chancellor of Germany. Following the 1934 death in office of Paul von Hindenburg, President of Germany, Hitler's cabinet passes a law proclaiming the presidency vacant and transferring the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler, hereafter known as Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor). The Weimar Republic effectively gives way to Nazi Germany, a Totalitarian autocratic national socialist dictatorship committed to repudiating the Treaty of Versailles, persecuting and removing Jews and other minorities from German society, expanding Germany's territory, and opposing the spread of communism."
1930s,"Hitler pulls Germany out of the League of Nations, but hosts the 1936 Summer Olympics to show his new Reich to the world as well as the supposed superior athleticism of his Aryan troops/athletes. Neville Chamberlain, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1937–1940), attempts the appeasement of Hitler in hope of avoiding war by allowing the dictator to annex the Sudetenland (the German-speaking regions of Czechoslovakia) and later signing the Munich Agreement and promising constituents ""Peace for our time"". He is ousted in favor of Winston Churchill in May 1940, following the German invasion of Norway. The assassination of the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by a German-born Polish Jew triggers the Kristallnacht (""Night of Broken Glass"") which occurred between 9 and 10 November 1938, carried out by the Hitler Youth, the Gestapo, and the SS, during which much of the Jewish population living in Nazi Germany and Austria was attacked – 91 Jews were murdered, and between 25,000 and 30,000 more were arrested and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Some 267 synagogues were destroyed, and thousands of homes and businesses were ransacked. Kristallnacht also served as the pretext for the wholesale confiscation of firearms from German Jews. Franklin D. Roosevelt is elected President of the United States in November 1932. Roosevelt initiates a widespread social welfare strategy called the ""New Deal"" to combat the economic and social devastation of the Great Depression. The economic agenda of the ""New Deal"" was a radical departure from previous laissez-faire economics."
1930s,"Germany and Italy pursue territorial expansionist agendas. Germany demands the annexation of the Federal State of Austria and of other German-speaking territories in Europe. Between 1935 and 1936, Germany recovers the Saar and re-militarizes the Rhineland. Italy initially opposes Germany's aims for Austria, but in 1936 the two countries resolve their differences in the aftermath of Italy's diplomatic isolation following the start of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, and Germany becomes Italy's only remaining ally. Germany and Italy improve relations by forming an alliance against communism in 1936 with the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Germany annexes Austria in the Anschluss; the annexation of the Sudetenland follows negotiations which result in the Munich Agreement of 1938. The Italian invasion of Albania in 1939 succeeds in turning the Kingdom of Albania into an Italian protectorate. The vacant Albanian throne is claimed by Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.[3] Germany receives the Memel territory from Lithuania, occupies what remains of Czechoslovakia, and finally invades the Second Polish Republic, the last of these events resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1939, several countries of the Americas, including Canada, Cuba, and the United States, controversially deny asylum to hundreds of German Jewish refugees on board the MS St. Louis who are fleeing the Nazi regime's racist agenda of anti-Semitic persecution in Germany. In the end, no country accepts the refugees, and the ship returns to Germany with most of its passengers on board. Some commit suicide, rather than return to Nazi Germany."

The Earth's magnetic field not only protects the planet from harmful solar winds and radiation but also plays a vital role in the navigation of animals such as birds, sea turtles, and even some insects. These animals have the ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field and use it as a compass to navigate during their migrations. The Earth's crust is composed of several large plates that are in constant motion due to the movement of molten rock in the mantle. This process is known as plate tectonics and has been responsible for the formation of mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. Plate tectonics also plays a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate through the movement of carbon between the atmosphere and the lithosphere."
1930s,"The Earth's atmosphere is composed of several layers, each with its own unique characteristics. The lower layers contain the air we breathe and protect us from harmful solar radiation. The upper layers are home to the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Changes in the composition of the atmosphere, such as an increase in greenhouse gases, can have significant impacts on the Earth's climate. The Earth has a rich and diverse cultural history that spans thousands of years. From ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans to modern cultures around the world, humans have developed unique and complex societies that reflect their environment and values. The study of human cultures and their interactions with the environment is an essential part of understanding the Earth and its history. The Earth is a complex system that is interconnected in ways that we are still discovering. The study of the Earth system requires a holistic approach that considers the interactions between the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. This approach, known as Earth systems science, is critical to understanding the Earth's past, present, and future and developing sustainable solutions to the environmental and social challenges we face. The Earth is a unique and precious planet in the universe, and its existence is a result of a series of fortunate events and conditions. The presence of liquid water, the right distance from the Sun, and a stable climate are just some of the factors that have allowed life to thrive on Earth. As we continue to explore the universe and search for other habitable planets, the Earth serves as a reminder of the fragility and wonder of life and the importance of protecting and preserving our planet for future generations."
1940s,"The 1940s (pronounced ""nineteen-forties"" and commonly abbreviated as ""the '40s"" or ""the Forties"") was a decade that began on January 1, 1940, and ended on December 31, 1949. Most of World War II took place in the first half of the decade, which had a profound effect on most countries and people in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. The consequences of the war lingered well into the second half of the decade, with a war-weary Europe divided between the jostling spheres of influence of the Western world and the Soviet Union, leading to the beginning of the Cold War. To some degree internal and external tensions in the post-war era were managed by new institutions, including the United Nations, the welfare state, and the Bretton Woods system, facilitating the post–World War II economic expansion, which lasted well into the 1970s. The conditions of the post-war world encouraged decolonization and the emergence of new states and governments, with India, Pakistan, Israel, Vietnam, and others declaring independence, although rarely without bloodshed. The decade also witnessed the early beginnings of new technologies (such as computers, nuclear power, and jet propulsion), often first developed in tandem with the war effort, and later adapted and improved upon in the post-war era. The world population increased from about 2.25 to 2.5 billion over the course of the decade, with about 850 million births and 600 million deaths in total."
1940s,"Although the 1940s was a decade dominated by World War II, important and noteworthy films about a wide variety of subjects were made during that era. Hollywood was instrumental in producing dozens of classic films during the 1940s, several of which were about the war and some are on most lists of all-time great films. European cinema survived although obviously curtailed during wartime and yet many films of high quality were made in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Soviet Union and elsewhere in Europe. The cinema of Japan also survived. Akira Kurosawa and other directors managed to produce significant films during the 1940s. Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film Calling mr. Smith (1943) about current nazi crimes in occupied Europe during the war and about lies of nazi propaganda. Film Noir, a film style that incorporated crime dramas with dark images, became largely prevalent during the decade. Films such as The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep are considered classics and helped launch the careers of legendary actors such as Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner. The genre has been widely copied since its initial inception."
1940s,"In France during the war the tour de force Children of Paradise directed by Marcel Carné (1945), was shot in Nazi occupied Paris.[7][8][9] Memorable films from post-war England include David Lean's Great Expectations (1946) and Oliver Twist (1948), Carol Reed's Odd Man Out (1947) and The Third Man (1949), and Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death (1946), Black Narcissus (1946) and The Red Shoes (1948), Laurence Olivier's Hamlet, the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture and Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) directed by Robert Hamer. Italian neorealism of the 1940s produced poignant movies made in post-war Italy. Roma, città aperta directed by Roberto Rossellini (1945), Sciuscià directed by Vittorio De Sica (1946), Paisà directed by Roberto Rossellini (1946), La terra trema directed by Luchino Visconti (1948), The Bicycle Thief directed by Vittorio De Sica (1948), and Bitter Rice directed by Giuseppe De Santis (1949), are some well-known examples. In Japanese cinema, The 47 Ronin is a 1941 black and white two-part Japanese film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail (1945), and the post-war Drunken Angel (1948), and Stray Dog (1949), directed by Akira Kurosawa are considered important early works leading to his first masterpieces of the 1950s. Drunken Angel (1948), marked the beginning of the successful collaboration between Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune that lasted until 1965."
1940s,"As the 1940s went through times of hardship during and after WWII, the solution was significant rationing and fashion items and fabrics were no exception. Fashion became more utilitarian or function and comfortability over style. Besides this rationing, as a tribute, women's fashion also changed to reflect that and it was seen in the new silhouette that is featured suits. In order to feminize this, certain elements were added such as the straight knee-length skirts and accessories to complete the look. Even with the challenges imposed by shortages in rayon, nylon, wool, leather, rubber, metal (for snaps, buckles, and embellishments), and even the amount of fabric that could be used in any one garment, the fashion industry's wheels kept chugging slowly along, producing what it could. After the fall of France in 1940, Hollywood drove fashion in the United States almost entirely, with the exception of a few trends coming from war torn London in 1944 and 1945, as America's own rationing hit full force, and the idea of function seemed to overtake fashion, if only for a few short months until the end of the war. Fabrics shifted dramatically as rationing and wartime shortages controlled import items such as silk and furs. Floral prints seem to dominate the early 1940s, with the mid-to-late 1940s also seeing what is sometimes referred to as ""atomic prints"" or geometric patterns and shapes. The color of fashion seemed to even go to war, with patriotic nautical themes and dark greens and khakis dominating the color palettes, as trousers and wedges slowly replaced the dresses and more traditional heels due to shortages in stockings and gasoline. The most common characteristics of this fashion were the straight skirt, pleats, front fullness, squared shoulders with v-necks or high necks, slim sleeves and the most favorited necklines were sailor, mandarin and scalloped."
1940s,"Bing Crosby was the best selling pop artist of the 1940s. Crosby was the leading figure of the crooner sound as well as its most iconic, defining artist. By the 1940s, he was an entertainment superstar who mastered all of the major media formats of the day, movies, radio, and recorded music. The most popular music style during the 1940s was swing, which prevailed during World War II. In the later periods of the 1940s, less swing was prominent and crooners like Frank Sinatra, along with genres such as bebop and the earliest traces of rock and roll, were the prevalent genre. During the 1940s, sporting events were disrupted and changed by the events that engaged and shaped the entire world. The 1940 and 1944 Olympic Games were cancelled because of World War II. During World War II in the United States Heavyweight Boxing Champion Joe Louis and numerous stars and performers from American baseball and other sports served in the armed forces until the end of the war. Among the many baseball players (including well known stars) who served during World War II were Moe Berg, Joe DiMaggio, Bob Feller, Hank Greenberg, Stan Musial (in 1945), Warren Spahn, and Ted Williams. They like many others sacrificed their personal and valuable career time for the benefit and well-being of the rest of society. The Summer Olympics were resumed in 1948 in London and the Winter games were held that year in St. Moritz, Switzerland. In 1947, Wataru Misaka of the New York Knicks became the first person of color to play in modern professional basketball, just months after Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier in Major League Baseball for the Brooklyn Dodgers."
1940s,"During the early 1940s World War II had an enormous impact on Major League Baseball as many players including many of the most successful stars joined the war effort. After the war many players returned to their teams, while the major event of the second half of the 1940s was the 1945 signing of Jackie Robinson to a players contract by Branch Rickey the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Signing Robinson opened the door to the integration of Major League Baseball finally putting an end to the professional discrimination that had characterized the sport since the 19th century. During the mid-1930s and throughout the years leading up to the 1940s Joe Louis was an enormously popular Heavyweight boxer. In 1936, he lost an important 12 round fight (his first loss) to the German boxer Max Schmeling and he vowed to meet Schmeling once again in the ring. Louis' comeback bout against Schmeling became an international symbol of the struggle between the US and democracy against Nazism and Fascism. When on June 22, 1938, Louis knocked Schmeling out in the first few seconds of the first round during their rematch at Yankee Stadium, his sensational comeback victory riveted the entire nation. Louis enlisted in the U.S. Army on January 10, 1942, in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Louis' cultural impact was felt well outside the ring. He is widely regarded as the first African American to achieve the status of a nationwide hero within the United States, and was also a focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during World War II."

Many popular songs from this period remain classics to this day, and continue to be celebrated and enjoyed around the world.

During the war years, many football leagues were suspended or cancelled, and many players and teams were forced to disband or relocate due to military service or wartime conditions. In England, the Football League was suspended from 1939 until 1946, with a wartime league and various regional leagues taking its place during this period. The FA Cup was also disrupted, with smaller competitions and regional cups being held instead. Despite these challenges, football remained a popular form of entertainment and morale-boosting for soldiers and civilians alike.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean in the world, stretching over an area of approximately 106.4 million square kilometers. It is bounded by North and South America to the west, Europe and Africa to the east, and the Southern Ocean to the south. The ocean is named after the ancient Greek god Atlas. The Atlantic Ocean is home to a vast array of marine life, including whales, dolphins, sharks, and various species of fish and crustaceans. It is also a major shipping route, connecting the Americas with Europe, Africa, and other parts of the world. The ocean has played a crucial role in world history and commerce, with numerous historical events and landmarks associated with it. For example, the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 occurred in the North Atlantic, and the Bermuda Triangle, a region in the western part of the ocean, has long been associated with mysterious disappearances of ships and aircraft. The Atlantic Ocean also plays a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate, with its currents and circulation patterns helping to distribute heat and moisture around the globe. However, the ocean is facing a number of environmental threats, including pollution, overfishing, and climate change, which are putting the health and sustainability of its ecosystems at risk."

1950s,"Urbanization refers to the process of people moving from rural areas to urban areas in search of employment, better living conditions, and other opportunities. This phenomenon has been on the rise since the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and it has continued to increase rapidly in the 20th century. One of the main drivers of urbanization is the growth of industries and the expansion of the service sector. As more and more jobs become available in urban areas, people move from rural areas to take advantage of these opportunities. This leads to the development of large cities, which can become centers of economic, social, and cultural activity. Urbanization also leads to significant changes in the built environment. As more people move to urban areas, the demand for housing, infrastructure, and services increases. This results in the construction of more buildings, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure, which can have both positive and negative effects on the environment. The rapid pace of urbanization can also result in overcrowding, pollution, and other negative impacts on public health. Urban areas are often characterized by high levels of air pollution, traffic congestion, and overcrowding, which can lead to increased rates of respiratory diseases and other health problems."
1950s,"One of the major challenges associated with urbanization is the issue of inequality. As cities grow, disparities in income, access to services, and quality of life can become more pronounced. This can lead to social unrest and political instability, as marginalized groups demand greater rights and opportunities. Urbanization can also have a significant impact on the natural environment. As cities expand, they often encroach on natural habitats and green spaces, leading to the destruction of wildlife and ecosystems. Additionally, urbanization can result in increased energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Urbanization has also led to the development of new technologies and innovations. As cities grow and become more complex, they require new solutions to address challenges such as transportation, waste management, and energy consumption. This has led to the development of new technologies and innovations that can improve quality of life and reduce negative impacts on the environment. Urbanization has also had a significant impact on culture and society. As people from different backgrounds and cultures come together in cities, new forms of music, art, and literature can emerge. Additionally, cities can serve as centers of education and knowledge, leading to the development of new ideas and innovations."
1950s,"One of the major trends in urbanization is the growth of mega-cities, which are cities with populations exceeding 10 million people. These cities are often characterized by high levels of density, diversity, and economic activity. However, they can also face significant challenges related to governance, infrastructure, and social cohesion. Finally, urbanization is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that can have both positive and negative impacts. While it can provide new opportunities and improve quality of life for many people, it can also lead to significant social, economic, and environmental challenges. As such, it is important to carefully manage and plan for urbanization to ensure that it is sustainable, equitable, and beneficial for all. Urbanization can also have a significant impact on the natural environment. As cities expand, they often encroach on natural habitats and green spaces, leading to the destruction of wildlife and ecosystems. Additionally, urbanization can result in increased energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. The Europa League features a group stage followed by knockout rounds, with the winners of the final being crowned the Europa League champions. The competition is open to clubs from UEFA's member associations, and the number of entrants is determined by the coefficients of the national associations. This means that clubs from the strongest associations, such as Spain, Germany, and England, are given more entries than clubs from weaker associations."
1950s,"Urbanization has also led to the development of new forms of transportation. As cities become more congested, people are turning to alternative forms of transportation such as bicycles, electric scooters, and public transit. This has led to the development of new technologies and innovations in the transportation sector. Another challenge associated with urbanization is the issue of social inequality. As cities grow, disparities in income, education, and access to services can become more pronounced. This can lead to social unrest and political instability. The Europa League, formerly known as the UEFA Cup, is an annual football club competition organized by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). The competition features some of the best football clubs from across Europe, including those who have not qualified for the more prestigious UEFA Champions League. The Europa League has been running since 1971, and has undergone a number of format changes over the years. The Europa League has a rich history, with some of the biggest clubs in Europe having won the competition. These include Sevilla, Liverpool, Juventus, Inter Milan, and Atletico Madrid. The competition has also produced some of the most memorable moments in European football, including Fulham's remarkable run to the final in 2010, and Porto's stunning victory over Celtic in the final in 2003. The Europa League is also known for producing surprise results, with smaller clubs often able to upset more established teams. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as a lack of preparation, complacency, or an underestimation of the opposition. As such, the Europa League is a competition that rewards teams who are able to remain focused and disciplined, and who are able to perform at their best on the day."
1950s,"One of the main advantages of the Europa League is that it provides a platform for clubs who may not have the resources to compete in the Champions League. This allows clubs from smaller countries, such as Switzerland, Austria, and Croatia, to showcase their talents on the European stage, and to compete against some of the best clubs in Europe. The Europa League also provides an opportunity for players to gain valuable experience, and for managers to test their tactics against some of the best teams in the world. The Europa League is a highly competitive competition that requires a great deal of skill, preparation, and tactical awareness. Many of the clubs that compete in the Europa League are also competing in domestic leagues, which means that they often have to balance their commitments across multiple competitions. This can be a difficult task, as the Europa League features a grueling schedule that can include long trips to far-flung destinations. One of the key factors that can determine success in the Europa League is squad depth. Clubs that have a deep pool of players are often better equipped to cope with the demands of the competition, and are able to rotate their squads effectively. This allows managers to rest key players when necessary, and to keep their squads fresh for the more important matches. Another factor that can impact success in the Europa League is tactical flexibility. The competition features a diverse range of playing styles, and teams must be able to adapt their tactics to counter the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents. This requires a deep understanding of the game, and the ability to make quick and decisive changes to the team's formation and strategy."

The 1970s also saw the first Earth Day in 1970, which continues to be celebrated as an annual event around the world. I hope these texts provide you with the information you are looking for! In the 21st century, historians have increasingly portrayed the 1970s as a ""pivot of change"" in world history, focusing especially on the economic upheavals[1] that followed the end of the postwar economic boom.[2] On a global scale, it was characterized by frequent coups, domestic conflicts and civil wars, and various political upheaval and armed conflicts which arose from or were related to decolonization, and the global struggle between NATO, the Warsaw Pact, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Many regions had periods of high-intensity conflict, notably Southeast Asia, the Mideast, and Africa."
1970s,"The 1970s was a decade of social and political upheaval. In the United States, the civil rights movement had given way to the women's liberation movement and the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. The Vietnam War was raging on and protests against it were happening all over the world. Meanwhile, in Europe, student protests were taking place and terrorism was on the rise. It was a time of change and activism. The 1970s was also a time of significant technological advancement. The development of the microprocessor in 1971 paved the way for the personal computer revolution. Sony introduced the first portable cassette player, the Walkman, in 1979. Cable television became widespread, and the first commercial cell phone was introduced in 1973. These innovations changed the way we communicate and consume media, paving the way for the digital age we know today. In the Western world, social progressive values that began in the 1960s, such as increasing political awareness and economic liberty of women, continued to grow. In the United Kingdom, the 1979 election resulted in the victory of its Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, the first female British Prime Minister. Industrialized countries experienced an economic recession due to an oil crisis caused by oil embargoes by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. The crisis saw the first instance of stagflation which began a political and economic trend of the replacement of Keynesian economic theory with neoliberal economic theory, with the first neoliberal government coming to power with the 1973 Chilean coup d'état."
1970s,"The 1970s was a golden age for music. Rock and roll continued to dominate the airwaves, but new genres like disco, punk, and funk emerged. Some of the most iconic bands and artists of all time were at their peak in the 1970s, including Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, and Fleetwood Mac. It was a time when music truly united people across the world. The energy crisis of the 1970s had a profound impact on the global economy. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed an oil embargo in 1973, leading to a spike in oil prices and fuel shortages. This, in turn, led to inflation, recession, and unemployment. Governments responded with policies to promote energy conservation and the development of alternative energy sources. The 1970s was also a decade of fashion experimentation. The hippie counterculture of the 1960s gave way to disco fashion and glam rock. Women's fashion became more diverse and colorful, with miniskirts, maxi dresses, and platform shoes. Men's fashion saw the rise of bell-bottoms, wide lapels, and big collars. The fashion of the 1970s was a reflection of the decade's cultural diversity and freedom of expression. The 1970s was also an era of great technological and scientific advances; since the appearance of the first commercial microprocessor, the Intel 4004 in 1971, the decade was characterised by a profound transformation of computing units – by then rudimentary, spacious machines – into the realm of portability and home accessibility."
1970s,"As the 1960s ended, the United States had made two successful crewed lunar landings. Many Americans lost interest afterward, feeling that since the country had accomplished President John F. Kennedy's goal of landing on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, there was no need for further missions. There was also a growing sentiment that the billions of dollars spent on the space program should be put to other uses. The Moon landings continued through 1972, but the near loss of the Apollo 13 mission in April 1970 served to further anti-NASA feelings. Plans for missions up to Apollo 20 were canceled, and the remaining Apollo and Saturn hardware was used for the Skylab space station program in 1973–1974, and for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), which was carried out in July 1975. Many of the ambitious projects NASA had planned for the 1970s were canceled amid heavy budget cutbacks, and instead it would devote most of the decade to the development of the Space Shuttle. ASTP was the last crewed American space flight for the next five years. The year 1979 witnessed the spectacular reentry of Skylab over Australia. NASA had planned for a Shuttle mission to the space station, but the shuttles were not ready to fly until 1981, too late to save it."
1970s,"Meanwhile, the Soviets, having failed in their attempt at crewed lunar landings, canceled the program in 1972. By then, however, they had already begun Salyut, the world's first space station program, which began in 1971. This would have problems of its own, especially the tragic loss of the Soyuz 11 crew in July 1971 and the near-loss of the Soyuz 18a crew during launch in April 1975. It eventually proved a success, with missions as long as six months being conducted by the end of the decade. In terms of unmanned missions, a variety of lunar and planetary probes were launched by the US and Soviet programs during the decade. The most successful of these include the Soviet Lunokhod program, a series of robotic lunar missions which included the first unmanned sample return from another world, and the American Voyagers, which took advantage of a rare alignment of the outer planets to visit all of them except Pluto by the end of the 1980s. China entered the space race in 1970 with the launching of its first satellite, but technological backwardness and limited funds would prevent the country from becoming a significant force in space exploration. Japan launched a satellite for the first time in 1972. The European Space Agency was founded during the decade as well."

The earthquake caused extensive damage and loss of life, with over 66,000 people killed and over 600,000 left homeless. The quake triggered landslides and tsunamis, causing even further destruction. The Peruvian government struggled to provide aid and relief to the affected regions, leading to widespread criticism. In 1972, Hurricane Agnes became the costliest hurricane in US history, causing over $2 billion in damage (adjusted for inflation). The storm affected 14 US states and caused widespread flooding, particularly in Pennsylvania and New York. The floods destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, and caused the deaths of over 100 people. The disaster prompted a re-evaluation of US flood management policies. On June 6, 1975, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 struck the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. The earthquake, which lasted for around 20 seconds, caused widespread destruction and loss of life. The final death toll was over 5,000, with many more injured and left homeless. The quake also triggered landslides and caused a tsunami that affected the coasts of several nearby islands."
1970s,"The 1976 Tangshan earthquake in China is considered one of the deadliest in modern history. With a magnitude of 7.6, the quake struck on July 28, 1976, and caused the deaths of over 240,000 people. The earthquake caused widespread destruction, with many buildings and homes reduced to rubble. The Chinese government struggled to provide aid and relief to the affected regions, leading to criticism and unrest. The 1978 Blizzard in the US affected the eastern seaboard, with the states of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania being hit the hardest. The blizzard brought record-breaking snowfall and temperatures, causing power outages and transportation disruptions. The storm caused over $520 million in damages (adjusted for inflation), and led to the deaths of over 70 people. The blizzard prompted a re-evaluation of US emergency preparedness and response measures. In 1976, the Tangshan earthquake struck China, measuring a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale. It was one of the deadliest earthquakes in modern history, resulting in over 240,000 deaths and extensive damage to infrastructure and buildings. The 1970 Bhola cyclone, also known as the Great Bhola Cyclone, hit East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and West Bengal, India, causing widespread devastation. With winds exceeding 185 km/h (115 mph) and a storm surge that flooded much of the coast, the disaster claimed the lives of up to half a million people."
1970s,"In 1977, the Tenerife airport disaster occurred when two Boeing 747s collided on the runway of Los Rodeos Airport in the Canary Islands. The crash killed 583 people, making it the deadliest aviation accident in history. The 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes remains one of the most significant tornado outbreaks in US history. Between April 3-4, 148 tornadoes struck across 13 US states, resulting in 330 deaths and over 5,000 injuries. The 1975 Banqiao Dam failure in China was caused by heavy rainfall from Typhoon Nina, which resulted in the collapse of the dam and subsequent flooding. An estimated 230,000 people lost their lives as a result of the disaster, which remains one of the deadliest engineering failures in history. The Cyclone Bhola, which struck East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1970, was one of the deadliest natural disasters in history. The storm killed over 500,000 people and left millions homeless. In 1971, the San Fernando earthquake struck Southern California, causing widespread damage and resulting in 65 fatalities. The quake measured 6.6 on the Richter scale and caused an estimated $553 million in property damage. The Tangshan earthquake, which occurred in China in 1976, was one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. The quake measured 7.8 on the Richter scale and is estimated to have killed between 240,000 and 650,000 people."
1970s,"In 1977, a series of severe thunderstorms struck the United States, causing widespread flooding and landslides in many areas. The storms, which affected several states, resulted in at least 60 deaths and caused millions of dollars in damage. The eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state in 1980 is often considered to be one of the most significant natural disasters of the 1970s. The eruption, which measured 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, resulted in 57 deaths and caused widespread damage to the surrounding area. In 1976, a devastating earthquake struck Tangshan, China, resulting in the deaths of approximately 240,000 people. The earthquake, which measured 7.6 on the Richter scale, was one of the deadliest natural disasters of the 20th century. The 1970 Bhola cyclone, which struck Bangladesh (then East Pakistan), was one of the deadliest tropical cyclones on record, with an estimated death toll of up to 500,000 people. The cyclone caused widespread damage and displacement of people in the region. In 1971, Mount Etna, a volcano located in Italy, erupted, resulting in the loss of life and property damage. The eruption was one of the most significant volcanic events of the 20th century."
1970s,"The 1972 Iran blizzard, which lasted from February 3 to 9, resulted in the deaths of approximately 4,000 people. The blizzard, which struck northern and central Iran, left many people stranded without shelter, food, or medical aid. The 1970 Ancash earthquake in Peru, which measured 7.9 on the Richter scale, resulted in the deaths of approximately 66,000 people. The earthquake caused widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure in the region, and many people were left homeless as a result. In the 1970s, the world experienced a series of natural disasters that left devastating impacts on many communities. The earthquake in Tangshan, China in 1976 was one of the deadliest, killing an estimated 240,000 people and leaving over 500,000 injured. The disaster also caused significant economic damage, with estimates suggesting that it cost China around $10 billion in damages. The 1970s also saw several major hurricanes and typhoons that caused significant damage and loss of life. In 1975, Typhoon Nina struck China and resulted in the deaths of over 200,000 people, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters of the decade. Hurricane Camille, which hit the United States in 1970, caused more than $1 billion in damages and claimed over 250 lives."
1970s,"The 1970s were also marked by several major volcanic eruptions that caused significant environmental impacts. The eruption of Mount St. Helens in the United States in 1980, for example, resulted in the loss of hundreds of square miles of forest and the destruction of many wildlife habitats. The ash from the eruption also caused significant health problems for nearby communities. In addition to earthquakes, hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions, the 1970s saw a number of other natural disasters that left lasting impacts on communities around the world. For example, the drought that hit the Sahel region of Africa in the mid-1970s caused widespread famine and displacement, leading to the deaths of an estimated 200,000 people. The impacts of natural disasters in the 1970s were felt not only in terms of loss of life and property damage, but also in terms of their effects on the environment and on the economy. The oil crisis of the 1970s, for example, was partly caused by the disruption of oil supplies due to natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. These disasters also highlighted the need for better disaster preparedness and response measures, leading to the development of new policies and initiatives aimed at mitigating the impacts of natural disasters in the future."
1970s,"In 1976, a powerful earthquake struck the city of Tangshan, China, causing massive destruction and loss of life. The official death toll was estimated at over 240,000, making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. The disaster also caused significant economic damage, with entire neighborhoods and industrial areas completely destroyed. The drought that plagued the Sahel region of Africa in the 1970s was one of the worst in the 20th century, causing widespread famine and displacement of people. Millions of people were affected by the drought, which was exacerbated by conflict and political instability in the region. The impacts of the disaster are still felt today, as many areas of the Sahel remain vulnerable to drought and food insecurity. The eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 had a significant impact on the surrounding environment and communities. The eruption released a huge amount of ash and debris into the air, causing widespread damage to crops and infrastructure. The resulting landslide and pyroclastic flow also caused numerous fatalities and injuries, as well as destroying hundreds of homes and businesses. The 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes was one of the largest and most destructive tornado outbreaks in US history, causing over $600 million in damages and killing over 300 people. The outbreak impacted the economy of the affected regions, as businesses were destroyed and many people lost their homes and jobs."
1970s,"The Bhola cyclone that struck Bangladesh in 1970 was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. The storm surge caused by the cyclone inundated large areas of low-lying land, causing extensive damage to infrastructure and agriculture. The death toll was estimated at over 500,000, making it one of the deadliest tropical cyclones ever recorded. The severe winter storms that hit the UK in 1978-79 caused widespread disruption and damage. Heavy snowfall and high winds caused power outages, transport chaos, and damage to buildings and infrastructure. The storms had a significant impact on the economy, with lost productivity and repair costs estimated at over £2 billion. In 1976, a massive earthquake hit the city of Tangshan, China, killing over 240,000 people and leaving millions homeless. The earthquake had a devastating impact on the region's economy, as infrastructure was destroyed and businesses were forced to shut down. It took years for the city to recover from the disaster. The tropical storm that hit the Philippines in 1970 caused widespread flooding and landslides, leading to over 300,000 deaths and leaving many more homeless. The storm destroyed much of the country's infrastructure, and the economic impact was felt for years to come. In 1975, the Banqiao Dam in China failed, leading to massive flooding and the deaths of over 230,000 people. The disaster had a significant impact on the economy of the region, as infrastructure was destroyed and the agricultural industry was severely impacted."
1970s,"The 1971 eruption of Mount Nyiragongo in the Democratic Republic of Congo caused significant damage to the city of Goma, including the destruction of homes, businesses, and infrastructure. The economic impact of the eruption was significant, as many people were left homeless and unable to work or provide for their families. The 1970s was an era of fuel price increases, rising insurance rates, safety concerns, and emissions controls. The 1973 oil crisis caused a move towards smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles. Attempts were made to produce electric cars, but they were largely unsuccessful. In the United States, imported cars became a significant factor for the first time, and several domestic-built subcompact models entered the market. American-made cars such as the ""quirky"" AMC Gremlin, the jelly bean shaped AMC Pacer, and Pontiac Firebird's powerful Trans Am ""sum up"" the decade. Muscle cars and convertible models faded from favor during the early-1970s. It was believed that the 1976 Cadillac Eldorado would be the last American-built convertible; ending the open body style that once dominated the auto industry. Automobiles in the U.S. reached the largest sizes they would ever attain, but by 1977, General Motors managed to downsize its full-size models to more manageable dimensions. Ford followed suit two years later, with Chrysler offering new small front-wheel-drive models, but was suffering from a worsening financial situation caused by various factors. By 1979, the company was near bankruptcy, and under its new president Lee Iacocca (who had been fired from Ford the year before), asked for a government bailout. American Motors beat out the U.S. Big Three to subcompact sized model (the Gremlin) in 1970, but its fortunes declined throughout the decade, forcing it into a partnership with the French automaker Renault in 1979."
1970s,"Revolut is a digital banking service that allows customers to manage their finances on the go. The Revolut card is a Mastercard that can be used to make purchases around the world without any hidden fees or commission charges. It is a popular choice for frequent travelers and anyone who wants to keep track of their spending. With the Revolut card, customers can easily manage their money using the Revolut app. The app lets users set up budgets, track their spending, and even exchange currencies at competitive rates.

Additionally, the card supports over 150 currencies, which means that users can pay in the local currency wherever they are. Revolut also offers a number of features that make it stand out from traditional banking services. For example, customers can use the app to set up recurring payments, split bills with friends, and even donate to charity. There are also premium plans available that offer additional benefits, such as travel insurance and airport lounge access. The 1970s started a mainstream affirmation of the environmental issues early activists from the 1960s, such as Rachel Carson and Murray Bookchin, had warned of. "
1970s,"Overall, the Revolut card is a convenient and easy-to-use banking service that is ideal for anyone looking for a simple and flexible way to manage their finances. With its wide range of features and competitive rates, it is a popular choice for people who value transparency and flexibility in their banking services. The Japanese automobile industry flourished during the 1970s, compared to other major auto markets. Japanese vehicles became internationally renowned for their affordability, reliability, and fuel-efficiency, which was very important to many customers after the oil crisis of 1973. Japanese car manufacturing focused on computerized robotic manufacturing techniques and lean manufacturing, contributing to high-efficiency and low production costs. The Honda Civic was introduced in 1973, and sold well due to its high fuel-efficiency. By 1975 Toyota overtook Volkswagen as the top-selling imported automobile brand in the U.S., with over a million cars sold per year by this point. Other popular compact cars included the Toyota Corolla and the Datsun Sunny, in addition to other cars from those companies and others such as Subaru, Mitsubishi, and Mazda. The Apollo 11 mission, which had occurred at the end of the previous decade, had transmitted back concrete images of the Earth as an integrated, life-supporting system and shaped a public willingness to preserve nature. On April 22, 1970, the United States celebrated its first Earth Day, in which over two thousand colleges and universities and roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools participated."
1970s,"The 1960s counterculture movement had rapidly undone many existing social taboos, and divorce, extramarital sex, and homosexuality were increasingly accepted in the Western world. The event of legalized abortion and over-the-counter birth control pills also played a major factor. Western Europe was in some ways more progressive on sexual liberation than the United States, as nudity in film and on TV had been gradually accepted there from the mid-1960s, and many European countries during this time began allowing women to go topless in public places. Nudist culture was also popular during the decade, especially in Germany and Scandinavia. Child erotica found a niche market, but would eventually be banned under child pornography laws in the 1980s to 1990s. Big Ben is the iconic clock tower located in the Palace of Westminster, London, England. Standing at over 96 meters tall, it has become one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. The name Big Ben is actually given to the bell inside the clock tower, which weighs over 13 tons. It was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who was the Commissioner of Works at the time of its construction. The clock tower was completed in 1859 and has undergone several renovations since then. Its distinctive sound can be heard throughout London and is often used in films and television shows as a symbol of British culture. The clock faces on Big Ben are over 7 meters in diameter and are made up of over 300 pieces of opal glass. The minute hand alone measures over 4 meters in length. In recent years, Big Ben has been undergoing a major renovation project which began in 2017 and is expected to last until 2021. The project includes repairs to the clock faces, the mechanism, and the tower itself. During this time, the clock has been temporarily silenced, making it a rare event to hear the famous chimes."
1980s,"The 1980s (pronounced ""nineteen-eighties"", shortened to ""the '80s"" or ""the Eighties"") was a decade that began January 1, 1980 and ended December 31, 1989. The decade saw a dominance of conservatism and free market economics, and a socioeconomic change due to advances in technology and a worldwide move away from planned economies and towards laissez-faire capitalism compared to the 1970s. As economic deconstruction increased in the developed world, multiple multinational corporations associated with the manufacturing industry relocated into Thailand, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and China. Japan and West Germany saw large economic growth during this decade. The AIDS epidemic became recognized in the 1980s and has since killed an estimated 39 million people (as of 2013). Global warming became well known to the scientific and political community in the 1980s. The United Kingdom and the United States moved closer to supply-side economic policies, beginning a trend towards global instability of international trade that would pick up more steam in the following decade as the fall of the USSR made right-wing economic policy more powerful. The final decade of the Cold War opened with the US-Soviet confrontation continuing largely without any interruption. Superpower tensions escalated rapidly as President Reagan scrapped the policy of détente and adopted a new, much more aggressive stance on the Soviet Union. The world came perilously close to nuclear war for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, but the second half of the decade saw a dramatic easing of superpower tensions and ultimately the total collapse of Soviet communism."
1980s,"Developing countries across the world faced economic and social difficulties as they suffered from multiple debt crises in the 1980s, requiring many of these countries to apply for financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Ethiopia witnessed widespread famine in the mid-1980s during the corrupt rule of Mengistu Haile Mariam, resulting in the country having to depend on foreign aid to provide food to its population and worldwide efforts to address and raise money to help Ethiopians, such as the Live Aid concert in 1985. Major civil discontent and violence occurred, including the Angolan Civil War, the Ethiopian Civil War, the Moro conflict, the Ugandan Bush War, the insurgency in Laos, the Iran–Iraq War, the Soviet–Afghan War, the 1982 Lebanon War, the Second Sudanese Civil War, the Lord's Resistance Army insurgency, and the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. Islamism became a powerful political force in the 1980s and many jihadist organizations, including Al Qaeda, were set up.By 1986, nationalism was making a comeback in the Eastern Bloc, and the desire for democracy in socialist states, combined with economic recession, resulted in Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika, which reduced Communist Party power, legalized dissent and sanctioned limited forms of capitalism such as joint ventures with companies from capitalist countries. "
1980s,"After tension for most of the decade, by 1988 relations between the communist and capitalist blocs had improved significantly and the Soviet Union was increasingly unwilling to defend its governments in satellite states. 1989 brought the overthrow and attempted overthrow of a number of governments led by communist parties, such as in Hungary, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in China, the Czechoslovak ""Velvet Revolution"", Erich Honecker's East German regime, Poland's Soviet-backed government, and the violent overthrow of the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime in Romania. Destruction of the 155-km Berlin Wall, at the end of the decade, signaled a seismic geopolitical shift. The Cold War ended in the early 1990s with the successful Reunification of Germany and the USSR's demise after the August Coup of 1991. The 1980s saw great advances in genetic and digital technology. After years of animal experimentation since 1985, the first genetic modification of 10 adult human beings took place in May 1989, a gene tagging experiment which led to the first true gene therapy implementation in September 1990. The first ""designer babies"", a pair of female twins, were created in a laboratory in late 1989 and born in July 1990 after being sex-selected via the controversial assisted reproductive technology procedure preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Gestational surrogacy was first performed in 1985 with the first birth in 1986, making it possible for a woman to become a biological mother without experiencing pregnancy for the first time in history."
1980s,"The 1980s was also an era of tremendous population growth around the world, surpassing the 1970s and 1990s, and arguably being the largest in human history. Population growth was particularly rapid in a number of African, Middle Eastern, and South Asian countries during this decade, with rates of natural increase close to or exceeding 4% annually. The 1980s saw the advent of the ongoing practice of sex-selective abortion in China and India as ultrasound technology permitted parents to selectively abort baby girls. The global internet took shape in academia by the second half of the 1980s, as well as many other computer networks of both academic and commercial use such as USENET, Fidonet, and the Bulletin Board System. By 1989 the Internet and the networks linked to it were a global system with extensive transoceanic satellite links and nodes in most developed countries.[7] Based on earlier work, from 1980 onwards Tim Berners Lee formalized the concept of the World Wide Web by 1989. Television viewing became commonplace in the Third World, with the number of TV sets in China and India increasing by 15 and 10 times respectively. During the 1980s, the world population grew from 4.4 to 5.3 billion people. There were approximately 1.33 billion births and 480 million deaths."
1980s,"Video game consoles released in this decade included the continuing popularity of Atari 2600, Intellivision, Vectrex, Colecovision, SG-1000, NES/Famicom, Sega Master System, PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, Mega Drive/Genesis and Game Boy. Super Mario Bros. and Tetris were the decade's two best selling and most popular video games. 1980's Atari VCS port of Space Invaders was the first killer app. Pac-Man was the decade's highest grossing arcade game. Home computers in that decade include the Commodore 64, VIC-20, the Apple II series, the Atari 8-bit family, Atari ST, Amiga, ZX Spectrum and MSX. Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows and IBM PC compatible were also introduced in that decade and helped popularize personal computers. Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989) – a war fought between the Soviet Union and the Islamist Mujahideen Resistance in Afghanistan. The mujahideen found other support from a variety of sources including the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States (see Operation Cyclone), as well as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations through the context of the Cold War and the regional India–Pakistan conflict. Invasion of Grenada (1983) – a 1983 U.S.-led invasion of Grenada, triggered by a military coup which ousted a brief revolutionary government. The successful invasion led to a change of government but was controversial due to charges of American imperialism, Cold War politics, the involvement of Cuba, the unstable state of the Grenadian government, and Grenada's status as a Commonwealth realm."
1980s,"Salvadoran Civil War (1980–1992) – part of the cold war conflicts, reached its peak in the 1980s, 70,000 Salvadorans died. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, sparking the Falklands War. It occurred from April 2 to July 14, 1982, between the United Kingdom and Argentina as British forces fought to recover the islands. Britain emerged victorious and its stance in international affairs and its long-decaying reputation as a colonial power received an unexpected boost. The military junta of Argentina, on the other hand, was left humiliated by the defeat; and its leader Leopoldo Galtieri was deposed three days after the end of the war. A military investigation known as the Rattenbach Report even recommended his execution. 1982 Lebanon War – the Government of Israel ordered the invasion as a response to the assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shlomo Argov, by the Abu Nidal Organization and due to the constant terror attacks on northern Israel made by the terrorist organizations which resided in Lebanon. After attacking the PLO, as well as Syrian, leftist and Muslim Lebanese forces, Israel occupied southern Lebanon and eventually surrounded the PLO in west Beirut and subjected to heavy bombardment, they negotiated passage from Lebanon. In October 1985 eight Israeli F-15 Eagles carried out Operation Wooden Leg intending to bomb the PLO's new headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, more than 2,000 km from Israel. The attack cost 270 lives, most of them Tunisian civilians. The attack was later condemned by the United Nations Security Council. The United States is thought to have assisted or known of the attack."
1980s,"The Iran–Iraq War took place from 1980 to 1988. Iraq was accused of using illegal chemical weapons to kill Iranian forces and against its own dissident Kurdish populations. Both sides suffered enormous casualties, but the poorly equipped Iranian armies suffered worse for it, being forced to use soldiers as young as 15 in human-wave attacks. Iran finally agreed to an armistice in 1988. The United States launched an aerial bombardment of Libya in 1986 in retaliation for Libyan support of terrorism and attacks on US personnel in Germany and Turkey. The South African Border War between South Africa and the alliance of Angola, Namibia and Zambia ended in 1989, ending over thirty years of conflict. The United States engaged in significant direct and indirect conflict in the decade via alliances with various groups in a number of Central and South American countries claiming that the U.S. was acting to oppose the spread of communism and end illicit drug trade. The U.S. government supported the government of Colombia's attempts to destroy its large illicit cocaine-trafficking industry and provided support for right-wing military government in the Salvadoran civil war which became controversial after the El Mozote massacre on December 11, 1981, in which U.S.-trained Salvadoran paramilitaries killed 1000 Salvadoran civilians. The United States, along with members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, invaded Grenada in 1983. "
1980s,"Operation Opera – a 1981 surprise Israeli air strike that destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor being constructed near Baghdad. Israeli military intelligence assumed this was for the purpose of plutonium production to further an Iraqi nuclear weapons program. Israeli intelligence also believed that the summer of 1981 would be the last chance to destroy the reactor before it would be loaded with nuclear fuel. US President Reagan's decision to station intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe provoked mass protests involving more than one million people. In 1982, Canada gained official independence from the United Kingdom with the Canada Act 1982, authorized by the signature by Elizabeth II. This act severed all political dependencies of the United Kingdom in Canada (although the Queen remained the head of state). In 1986, Australia gained full independence from the United Kingdom with the Australia Act 1986, which severed the last remaining powers of the British government over the Australian government, including the removal of the privy council as the highest court of appeal. Australia retained the queen as head of state. In 1986, New Zealand and the United Kingdom fully separated New Zealand's governments from the influence of the British Parliament, resulting in New Zealand's full independence with the Constitution Act 1986 which also reorganized the New Zealand government."
1980s,"Independence was granted to Vanuatu from the British/French condominium (1980), Kiribati from joint US-British government (1981) and Palau from the United States (1986). Zimbabwe becomes independent from official colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1980. Independence was given to Antigua and Barbuda, Belize (both 1981), and Saint Kitts and Nevis (1983) in the Caribbean; Brunei (1984) and Thailand formed a US-British government (1981) in Southeast Asia. The European Community's enlargement continued with the accession of Greece in 1981 and Spain and Portugal in 1986. In 1983, Bettino Craxi became the first socialist to hold the office of Prime Minister of Italy; he remained in power until 1987, becoming one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers in the history of Italian Republic. At the end of his presidency the Mani pulite corruption scandal broke up, causing the collapse of the political system. Significant political reforms occurred in a number of communist countries in eastern Europe as the populations of these countries grew increasingly hostile and politically active in opposing communist governments. These reforms included attempts to increase individual liberties and market liberalization, and promises of democratic renewal. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe was generally peaceful, the exception being Romania, whose leader Nicolae Ceaușescu tried to keep the people isolated from the events happening outside the country. While making a speech in Bucharest in December 1989, he was booed and shouted down by the crowd, and then tried to flee the city with his wife Elena. Two days later, they were captured, charged with genocide, and shot on Christmas Day."
1980s,"In Yugoslavia, following the death of communist leader Josip Broz Tito in May 1980, the trend of political reform of the communist system occurred along with a trend towards ethnic nationalism and inter-ethnic hostility, especially in Serbia, beginning with the 1986 Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts followed by the agenda of Serbian communist leader Slobodan Milošević who aggressively pushed for increased political influence of Serbs in the late 1980s, condemning non-Serb Yugoslav politicians who challenged his agenda as being enemies of Serbs. There was continuing civil strife in Northern Ireland, including the adoption of hunger strikes by Irish Republican Army prisoners seeking the reintroduction of political status. Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, and initiated major reforms to the Soviet Union's government through increasing the rights of expressing political dissent and opening elections to opposition candidates (while maintaining legal dominance of the Communist Party). Gorbachev pursued negotiation with the United States to decrease tensions and eventually end the Cold War. During the Revolutions of 1989, most of the communist governments in Eastern Europe collapsed. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 would be followed in 1990 by the German reunification."
1980s,"The United Kingdom was governed by the Conservative Party under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the first female leader of a Western country. Under her Premiership, the party introduced widespread economic reforms including the privatisation of industries and the de-regulation of stock markets echoing similar reforms of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. She was also a staunch opponent of communism, earning her the nickname The Iron Lady. Poor industrial relations marked the beginning of the decade; the UK miners' strike (1984–85) was a major industrial action affecting the UK coal industry. The strike by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) was led by Arthur Scargill, although some NUM members considered it to be unconstitutional and did not observe it. The BBC has referred to the strike as ""the most bitter industrial dispute in British history.""[9] At its height, the strike involved 142,000 mineworkers, making it the biggest since the 1926 General Strike. In November 1982, Leonid Brezhnev, who had led the Soviet Union since 1964, died. He was followed in quick succession by Yuri Andropov, the former KGB chief, and Konstantin Chernenko, both of whom were in poor health during their short tenures in office. The Iran–Contra affair erupted which involved U.S. interventionism in Nicaragua, resulting in members of the U.S. government being indicted in 1986. U.S. military action began against Panama in December 1989 to overthrow its dictator, Manuel Noriega resulting in 3,500 civilian casualties and the restoration of democratic rule."
1980s,"Following the assassination of Park Chung-hee, South Korean president Chun Doo Hwan came to power at the end of 1979 and ruled as a dictator until his presidential term expired in 1987. He was responsible for the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980 when police and soldiers battled armed protesters. Relations with North Korea showed little sign of improvement during the 1980s. In 1983, when Chun was in Burma, a bomb apparently planted by North Korean agents killed a number of South Korean government officials. After leaving office, he was succeeded by Roh Tae Woo, the first democratic ruler of the country, which saw its international prestige greatly rise with hosting the Olympics in 1988. Roh pursued a policy of normalizing relations with China and the Soviet Union, but had to face militant left-wing student groups who demanded reunification with North Korea and the withdrawal of US troops. In the Philippines, after almost 20 years of dictatorship, Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos left the presidency and was replaced by Corazon Aquino through the ""People Power Revolution"" from February 22 to 25, 1986. This has been considered by some a peaceful revolution despite the fact that the Armed Forces of the Philippines issued an order to disperse the crowds on EDSA (the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila). Democratization in South Korea and Taiwan, having lasted 42 and 27 years under the authoritarian regime since the end of World War II and the Korean War (including the lifting of martial law in Taiwan and the first direct presidential elections in South Korea). The 1988 Summer Olympics were held in South Korea, the first time the country hosted them."
1980s,"Mount St. Helens erupted in Washington, U.S. on May 18, 1980, killing 57 people. On October 17, 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area during Game 3 of the 1989 World Series, gaining worldwide attention. Sixty-five people were killed and thousands injured, with major structural damage on freeways and buildings and broken gas-line fires in San Francisco, California. The cost of the damage totaled $13 billion (1989 USD). The 1988–89 North American drought decimated the US with many parts of the country affected. This was the worst drought to hit the United States in many years. The drought caused $60 billion in damage (between $80 billion and $120 billion for 2008 USD). The concurrent heat waves killed 5,800 to 17,000 people in the United States.

Arcade and video games had been growing in popularity since the late 1970s, and by 1982 were a major industry. But a variety of factors, including a glut of low-quality games and the rise of home computers, caused a tremendous crash in late 1983. For the next three years, the video game market practically ceased to exist in the US. But in the second half of the decade, it would be revived by Nintendo, whose Famicom console and mascot Mario had been enjoying considerable success in Japan since 1983. Renamed the Nintendo Entertainment System, it would claim 90% of the American video game market by 1989. The 1980s are considered to be the decade when video games achieved massive popularity. "
1980s,"In 1980, Pac-Man was introduced to the arcades, and became one of the most popular video games of all time. Also in 1980, Game & Watch was created; it was not one of the most well known game systems, but it facilitated mini-games and was concurrent with the NES. Donkey Kong, released in 1981, was a smash arcade hit and market breakthrough for Nintendo. Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda, and the Mega Man series would become major hits for the console. The personal computer experienced explosive growth in the 1980s, transitioning from a hobbyist's toy to a full-fledged consumer product. The IBM PC, launched in 1981, became the dominant computer for professional users. Commodore created the most popular home computers of both 8-bit and 16-bit generations. MSX standard was the dominant computer platform in Japan and in most parts of Asia. Apple Computer superseded its Apple II and Lisa models by introducing the first Macintosh computer in 1984. It was the first commercially successful personal computer to use a graphical user interface (GUI) and mouse, which started to become general features in computers after the middle of the decade. Electronics and computers were also at the forefront of the advertising industry, with many commercials like ""1984"" from Apple achieving acclaim and pop-culture relevance."
1980s,"Walkman and boomboxes, invented during the late 1970s, became very popular as they were introduced to various countries in the early 1980s, and had a profound impact on the music industry and youth culture. Consumer VCRs and video rental stores became commonplace as VHS won out over the competing Betamax standard. In addition, in the early 1980s various companies began selling compact, modestly priced synthesizers to the public. This, along with the development of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), made it easier to integrate and synchronize synthesizers and other electronic instruments, like drum machines, for use in musical composition. High definition television (HDTV) of both the analog and digital variety were first developed in the 1980s though their use did not become widespread until the mid-2000s. In 1981, Hayes Microcomputer Products started selling the Smartmodem. The Smartmodem paved the way for the modern modems that exist today, mainly because it was the first modem to transform what had previously required a two-stage process into a process involving only one stage. The Smartmodem contributed to the rise in popularity of BBS systems in the 80s and early 90s, which were the main way to connect to remote computers and perform various social and entertainment activities before the Internet and the World Wide Web finally became popular in the mid-1990s. Prince released an album every year for the rest of the decade, all charting within the top ten, with the exception of Lovesexy. In the 1990s, he infamously changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol in response to a record dispute with Warner Brothers. He went on to sell over 120 million records worldwide and win seven Grammy Awards."
1980s,"Michael Jackson was one of the icons of the 1980s and his leather jacket, white glove, and Moonwalk dance were often imitated. Jackson's 1982 album Thriller became—and currently remains—the best-selling album of all time, with sales estimated by various sources as somewhere between 65 and 110 million copies worldwide. His 1987 album Bad sold over 45 million copies and became the first album to have five number-one singles chart on the Billboard Hot 100. Jackson had the most number-one singles throughout the decade (9), and spent the most weeks at number one (27 weeks). His 1987 Bad World Tour grossed over $125 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing world tour by a solo artist during the decade. Jackson earned numerous awards and titles during the 1980s, the most notable of which were a record eight Grammy Awards and eight American Music Awards in 1984, and the honor of ""Artist of the Decade"" by U.S. President George H.W. Bush. Jackson was arguably the biggest star during this time, and would eventually sell more than one billion records around the world. Prince was a popular star of the 1980s and the most successful chart act of the decade. His breakthrough album 1999, released in 1982, produced three top-ten hits and the album itself charted at number nine on the Billboard 200. His sixth studio album Purple Rain was an international success, boosting Prince to superstardom and selling over 25 million copies worldwide. The album produced the US number-one singles, ""When Doves Cry"" and ""Let's Go Crazy"" and sold 13 million copies in the U.S. as of 1996. "
1980s,"Mount St. Helens Eruption: On May 18, 1980, the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state caused the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history. The blast killed 57 people, destroyed hundreds of homes, and caused more than $1 billion in damage. Mexico City Earthquake: On September 19, 1985, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck Mexico City, causing widespread damage and killing an estimated 10,000 people. The disaster led to changes in building codes and emergency preparedness in the region. Chernobyl Disaster: On April 26, 1986, the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine released a massive amount of radioactive material into the atmosphere. The disaster caused numerous deaths and illnesses, and led to increased awareness and regulation of nuclear power. Hurricane Gilbert: In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert struck the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, causing widespread damage and claiming more than 300 lives. The storm was one of the most powerful hurricanes on record at the time, with wind speeds reaching 185 mph. Ethiopian Famine: In the mid-1980s, a combination of drought and civil war led to a severe famine in Ethiopia. The disaster resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and sparked a massive international relief effort."
1980s,"Chernobyl is the name of a nuclear power plant located in Pripyat, Ukraine. On April 26, 1986, a reactor at the plant exploded, resulting in the release of radioactive material into the environment. This event is considered to be the worst nuclear accident in history, with long-term impacts that are still being felt today. The explosion at Chernobyl occurred during a safety test of one of the plant's reactors. The reactor was designed with a flawed control rod system, which led to a sudden increase in power output and subsequent explosion. The explosion released a significant amount of radioactive material into the air, which spread across much of Europe. The immediate aftermath of the explosion was chaotic. The plant workers who responded to the incident were not properly protected and suffered from acute radiation sickness. The local population was not immediately evacuated, and many people were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. The Soviet government did not initially acknowledge the severity of the accident, which hindered international response efforts. The scene also helped 1970s hard rock artists such as AC/DC, Heart, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Blue Öyster Cult, Deep Purple, Queen, Van Halen, KISS, Ronnie James Dio, Rush and Judas Priest reach a new generation of fans. The 1980s were also known for song parodies becoming more mainstream, a trend led by parodic musician ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. He was best known for his Michael Jackson parodies ""Eat It"" and ""Fat"" as well as other parodies like ""Another One Rides The Bus"" (parody of ""Another One Bites The Dust"" by Queen)."
1980s,"In the years following the disaster, the surrounding area was heavily contaminated with radioactive material. The town of Pripyat was evacuated, and a large exclusion zone was established around the plant. The long-term health effects of the disaster are still being studied, but it is estimated that thousands of people have died or will die as a result of radiation exposure. Today, the Chernobyl site remains contaminated and dangerous. Efforts are being made to contain the remaining radioactive material, but the site is expected to be hazardous for thousands of years. The disaster at Chernobyl served as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of nuclear power, and has led to increased safety regulations and improved emergency response protocols. Madonna and Whitney Houston were groundbreaking female artists of the decade.[citation needed] The keyboard synthesizer and drum machine were among the most popular instruments in music during the 1980s, especially in new wave music. After the 1980s, electronic instruments continued to be the main component of mainstream pop. Hard rock, heavy metal, and glam metal became some of the most dominant music genres of the decade, peaking with the arrival of such bands as Mötley Crüe, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Poison, Europe, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, and virtuoso guitarists such as Joe Satriani and Yngwie Malmsteen. "
1980s,"Mount St. Helens Eruption (19800. On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens erupted in Washington state, sending ash and debris into the atmosphere and causing widespread devastation in the surrounding area. The eruption caused over 50 deaths and resulted in millions of dollars in property damage. The ash plume from the eruption traveled around the world and caused temporary climate changes in many regions. Mexico City Earthquake (1985). On September 19, 1985, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck Mexico City, killing over 10,000 people and injuring thousands more. The earthquake caused widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure in the city, leaving many homeless and without basic necessities. The disaster highlighted the need for improved building codes and emergency response protocols in the region. Chernobyl Disaster (1986). On April 26, 1986, an explosion and fire occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, resulting in the release of radioactive materials into the environment. The disaster caused immediate deaths and illness, as well as long-term health impacts for many exposed to the radiation. The area around the plant remains heavily contaminated and is still restricted to human habitation."
1980s,"Hurricane Gilbert (1988). In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert swept through the Caribbean, Mexico, and the southern United States, causing over 300 deaths and billions of dollars in damages. The hurricane was one of the most intense ever recorded in the Atlantic, with wind speeds exceeding 180 mph. The storm caused widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure damage in the affected regions.Armenian Earthquake (1988). On December 7, 1988, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck northern Armenia, causing widespread destruction and killing over 25,000 people. The earthquake damaged or destroyed nearly half a million buildings and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless. The disaster highlighted the need for improved seismic safety measures and emergency response protocols in earthquake-prone regions. These natural disasters of the 1980s had significant impacts on the affected regions, and many of them highlighted the need for improved disaster preparedness and response measures. Tian Shan earthquake (1985): On August 23, 1985, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake struck the Tian Shan mountain range in Kazakhstan, causing significant damage and loss of life. The earthquake resulted in the deaths of at least 60 people and caused widespread destruction, including the collapse of buildings and landslides. Armenian earthquake (1988): On December 7, 1988, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck Armenia, causing widespread devastation and killing an estimated 25,000 people. The disaster was compounded by the fact that many of the buildings in the area were poorly constructed and unable to withstand the earthquake."
1980s,"Climate change was a growing concern in the 1980s, with increasing scientific evidence pointing to the negative impacts of human activities on the environment. Some key developments and events related to climate change in the 1980s include. The establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988, which has since become the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. In 1982, a report from the National Academy of Sciences concluded that carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning could lead to global warming. The 1980s also saw the emergence of the ""ozone hole"" in the Earth's atmosphere, which was caused by the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances. This led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which aimed to phase out the use of these substances. In 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen testified before the US Congress, stating that there was a high degree of certainty that human activities were causing global warming. This was one of the earliest warnings of the potential consequences of climate change. The 1980s were also marked by several extreme weather events, including droughts, heatwaves, and hurricanes. While it is difficult to directly attribute any one event to climate change, such events are consistent with the types of impacts that scientists have predicted as a result of global warming. Overall, the 1980s were a pivotal decade in the history of climate change, as scientific evidence continued to mount and awareness of the issue began to grow."
1980s,"Eurovision is an annual international song competition that has been running since 1956. It is organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and is held in the country that won the previous year's competition. The contest features participants from different countries, each of which submits a song to be performed on stage. The winner is determined by a combination of jury and public votes. Over the years, Eurovision has become a popular cultural phenomenon, attracting millions of viewers worldwide. The competition has also launched the careers of many successful artists, such as ABBA, Celine Dion, and Julio Iglesias. The first Eurovision contest was held in Lugano, Switzerland, in 1956, and was won by Switzerland's own Lys Assia. Since then, the competition has grown significantly, with more than 40 countries now participating. Each year's competition features a unique theme and stage design, and often includes performances from well-known artists as well as up-and-coming musicians. The contest has also been the subject of controversy over the years, particularly regarding the voting process and accusations of political bias. Despite these issues, Eurovision remains a beloved tradition for many Europeans, and continues to showcase the diverse musical talents of the continent. Certainly! Here's a brief report about Eurovision. ABBA is a Swedish pop group that was active from 1972 to 1982. The group consisted of two couples: Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog, and Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. Their music was a unique blend of catchy melodies, upbeat rhythms, and vocal harmonies that became an instant hit with audiences worldwide."
1980s,"ABBA gained worldwide fame after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 1974 with their hit song ""Waterloo."" From there, they went on to produce a string of chart-topping hits, including ""Dancing Queen,"" ""Mamma Mia,"" and ""Take a Chance on Me."" In addition to their success on the music charts, ABBA was known for their flamboyant and colorful stage performances. They often wore colorful, glittering costumes and used elaborate choreography and lighting to enhance their live shows. After a successful run in the 1970s, ABBA decided to take a break in the early 1980s, with each member pursuing solo projects. Despite this hiatus, their music continued to remain popular, and in 1992, a tribute album featuring covers of their hit songs was released. In 2018, the group announced that they had recorded two new songs, their first in over 35 years. Although they have not performed together as a group since their break, ABBA's music continues to be popular and influential in the pop music world. ABBA is one of the most successful bands in the history of pop music. The Swedish group formed in 1972 and quickly became popular in Europe, before achieving worldwide success with their hit song ""Waterloo"" at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. Over the course of their career, ABBA released numerous hit songs, including ""Dancing Queen,"" ""Mamma Mia,"" and ""Take a Chance on Me."" The beginning of the decade saw the continuation of the clothing styles of the late 1970s and evolved into heavy metal fashion by the end. However, fashion became more extravagant during the 1980s. The 1980s included teased and colourfully-dyed hair, ripped jeans, neon clothing and many colours and different designs which at first were not accepted."
1980s,"ABBA's music was known for its catchy melodies, harmonies, and upbeat, danceable rhythms. The band's sound was heavily influenced by disco and they were credited with popularizing the genre. ABBA's music and style also had a significant impact on popular culture and fashion, with their signature jumpsuits and platform shoes becoming iconic symbols of the 1970s. Despite their success, ABBA disbanded in 1982, but their music continued to be popular and influential for decades. In 1999, the musical ""Mamma Mia!"" premiered in London, featuring many of ABBA's hit songs. The musical was a huge success and led to a 2008 film adaptation starring Meryl Streep. In 2018, ABBA announced that they were reuniting to record new music for the first time in over three decades. The band also announced that they were developing a ""revolutionary"" hologram concert, which would allow fans to see a digital version of the band performing live. Despite setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ABBA released their first new songs in 40 years in 2021 and announced a new album and tour. Country music advanced into a new realm of popularity with youth appeal and record-breaking marks. Groundbreaking artists such as Alabama, Hank Williams, Jr., Reba McEntire, George Strait, Ricky Skaggs, Janie Fricke, The Judds, and Randy Travis achieved multiple platinum and award status, foreshadowing the genre's popularity explosion in the 1990s. Country legends from past decades, however; such as George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Conway Twitty, the Oak Ridge Boys, Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Merle Haggard, Don Williams, Crystal Gayle, Ronnie Milsap, Barbara Mandrell, and the Statler Brothers; also continued to score hits throughout the decade."
1980s,"The techno style of electronic dance music emerged in Detroit, Michigan, during the mid- to late 1980s. The house music style, another form of electronic dance music, emerged in Chicago, Illinois, in the early 1980s. It was initially popularized in mid-1980s discothèques catering to the African-American, Latino and gay communities, first in Chicago, then in New York City and Detroit. It eventually reached Europe before becoming infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide. A significant development in the home media business is the establishment of The Criterion Collection in 1984, an American company ""dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality"". Through their releases, they were able to introduce what is now a standard to home video: letterboxing to retain the original aspect ratio, film commentaries and supplements/special features. In 1985, two sitcoms premiered on the same day: The Golden Girls, starring Bea Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty, which lasted for seven seasons and was also the first comedy ever to feature four older women in title TV roles, and 227, which was originally the sitcom vehicle for Marla Gibbs, who previously starred in The Jeffersons, and which also launched Jackée Harry's career. Sketch comedy and variety show Saturday Night Live experienced turbulence for much of the 1980s, however, it propelled the successful careers of cast members like Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Martin Short, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Makeup on the 1980s was aggressive, shining and colourful. Women emphasised their lips, eyebrows and cheeks with makeup. They used much blush and eyeliner."
1990s,"The 1990s (pronounced ""nineteen-nineties"", shortened to ""the '90s"" and often referred to as simply ""the nineties"") was a decade that began on January 1, 1990, and ended on December 31, 1999. Known as the ""post-Cold War decade"", the 1990s are culturally imagined by many as the period from the Revolutions of 1989 until the Global War on Terror (""GWOT""), which included the September 11 attacks, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War.[1] The dissolution of the Soviet Union marked the end of Russia's status as a superpower and the end of a multipolar world, though Anti-Americanism remained in former soviet states. Russia was in economic chaos due to neoliberal free market reforms while China was still recovering from a politically and economically turbulent eighties. This allowed for the United States to emerge as the worlds sole superpower during this decade. In the United States and Canada, the decade saw greater attention to multiculturalism as well as the advance of alternative media. In the built environment the McMansion and schlock block version of postmodern architecture remained strong throughout the decade. Public education about safe sex curbed the spread of the HIV virus in wealthy countries. Generation X young people often bonded over musical tastes without needing to be part of an exclusive youth subculture. Humor in television and film was often marked by ironic self-reference mixed with popular culture references, in the manner of television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Alternative music movements like grunge, Eurodance, and hip-hop, became popular with young adults worldwide, aided by the rise in popularity of tiered pricing cable television, and the internet. New music genres such as DnB, post-rock, happy hardcore, denpa, and trance emerged in the 1990s. "
1990s,"The computer game industry began to boom again, rivalling the music and movie markets. Neverwinter Nights was the first multiplayer online role-playing game to display graphics and ran from 1991 to 1997 on AOL. Video game popularity exploded due to the development of CD-ROM supported 3DCG on platforms such as PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PCs. The 1990s saw advances in technology, with the World Wide Web, the evolution of the Pentium microprocessor in accordance with Moore's Law, rechargable lithium-ion batteries, the first gene therapy trial, and cloning all emerging and being improved upon throughout the decade. The Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990. Building of the Large Hadron Collider commenced in 1998. In 1998, Nasdaq (established 1971) became the first stock market in the United States to trade online, using the slogan ""the stock market for the next hundred years"". A combination of factors led to a realignment and consolidation of economic and political power across the world, such as the continued mass-mobilization of capital markets through neoliberalism, the end of the Cold War caused by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Network cultures were enhanced by the widespread proliferation of new media such as the internet, and a new ability to self-publish web pages and make positive connections on a wide variety of professional, political and hobby topics. The new medium was dubbed the information superhighway and soon used by the so called 'tech savvy'. The digital divide was immediate with access to the World Wide Web limited to those who could afford it and knew how to operate a home or business computer. The internet also provided a degree of anonymity for individuals skeptical of the government. Online anonymity and the semi-impersonal nature of communication by email and chat rooms led to the words troll and netiquette enter the English language. "
1990s,"Online scammers and sex offenders scared many people off the idea of home internet, and traditional mass media performed strongly. Surfing the web was a pastime frustrated by slow internet speeds and the WWW was nicknamed the World Wide Wait. However, mainstream internet users were optimistic about its benefits particularly the future of e-commerce. Web portals, (such as AOL, Yahoo!, Yahoo! GeoCities and Lycos), a type of curated bookmark homepage, were as popular as searching via web crawlers. The use of country specific web portals popularized the phrases netizen and global village. Many countries were economically prosperous and spreading globalization during the 1990s. High-income countries experienced steady economic growth throughout the majority of the decade during the Great Moderation. Using a mobile phone in a public place was typical conspicuous consumption in the decade. In contrast, the GDP of the states formed from the former Soviet Union declined, often as a result of economic restructuring and unstable national institutions. International trade increased with the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 and formation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. The ""dot-com frenzy"" resulted in the dot-com bubble of 1997–2000 that brought great wealth to some entrepreneurs before its crash of the early-2000s. The economies of the Four Asian Tigers (Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong), ASEAN, and Japan were hampered by the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the Lost Decades, causing the resignation of President Suharto and the May 1998 riots in Indonesia, after 32 years of rule."
1990s,"New ethnic conflicts emerged, such as the Rwandan genocide in Africa, the Bosnian genocide in the Balkans, and several wars in the Chechen–Russian conflict in Caucasus. The Rwandan genocide was exacerbated by state sanctioned hate speech in traditional mainstream media, particularly radio broadcasting. Signs of any resolution of tensions between Israel and the Arab world remained elusive, despite the progress of the Oslo Accords. However, in Northern Ireland, The Troubles came to a standstill in 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement, putting to rest 30 years of violence. During this decade, the world population grew from 5.3 to 6.1 billion people. There were approximately 1.35 billion births and 525 million deaths. The 1990s saw an increased spread of capitalism and third way policies. The former countries of the Warsaw Pact moved from single-party socialist states to multi-party states with private sector economies. The same wave of political liberalization occurred in the capitalist and newly industrialized countries (including First and Third World countries), such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Market reforms made incredible changes to the economies of Second World socialist countries such as China and Vietnam. Ethnic tensions and violence in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s created a greater sense of ethnic identity among nations in newly independent countries and a marked increase in the popularity of nationalism."
1990s,"The establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, created a North American free-trade zone consisting of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Canadian politics was radically altered in the 1993 federal election with the collapse of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. A major political party in Canada since 1867, the party went from controlling the government to being left with only two seats. The New Democratic Party collapsed as well, with their sets declining from 44 to 9. The Liberal Party of Canada was the only genuinely 'national' political party left standing. Regionally-based parties, such as the Quebec-based Bloc Québécois and the almost entirely Western Canada-based Reform Party of Canada, rose from political insignificance to being major political parties. After the collapse of the Meech Lake constitutional accord in 1990, the province of Quebec in Canada experienced a rekindled wave of separatism by Francophone Québécois nationalists, who sought for Quebec to become an independent country and forced a referendum on the question of independence in 1995. The 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty was held in the predominantly francophone province of Quebec in Canada, a majority Anglophone country. If accepted, Quebec would have become an independent country with an economic association with Canada. Quebec's voters narrowly rejected the proposal. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a former Haitian priest, became the first democratically elected President of Haiti in 1990. A proponent of liberation theology, Aristide was appointed to a Roman Catholic parish in Port-au-Prince in 1982 after completing his studies to become a priest of the Salesian order. "
1990s,"Aristide was later forced into exile in the Central African Republic and South Africa and returned to Haiti after several years. Ernesto Zedillo was elected President of Mexico in the 1994 presidential election, making him the last of an uninterrupted 72-year-long succession of Mexican presidents from the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The original PRI candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, was assassinated several months prior. Due to internal conflict and an economic crisis, Alberto Fujimori rose to power in Peru and remained in office for eleven years. His administration was marked by economic development but also by numerous human rights violations (La Cantuta massacre, Barrios Altos massacre) and a rampant corruption network set up by Vladimiro Montesinos. The sluggish Latin American economies of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their citizens after the debt crisis of the 1980s. Following democratic reforms and neoliberal policies were implemented by President Carlos Saúl Menem (Argentina), President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle (Chile), President Ernesto Zedillo (Mexico), and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso (Brazil), in their best shape by the late 1990s. United States President Bill Clinton was a dominant political figure in international affairs during the 1990s, known primarily for his attempts to negotiate peace in the Middle East and end the ongoing wars occurring in the former Yugoslavia, his promotion of international action to decrease human-created climate change, and his endorsement of advancing free trade in the Americas."
1990s,"Lewinsky scandal – US president Bill Clinton was caught in a media-frenzied scandal involving inappropriate relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which was first announced on January 21, 1998. After the United States House of Representatives impeached Bill Clinton on December 19, 1998, for perjury under oath, and following an investigation by federal prosecutor Kenneth Starr, the Senate acquitted Clinton of all charges on February 12, 1999. He served out the remainder of his second term. California voters passed Proposition 215 in 1996, which legalized cannabis for medicinal purposes. In 1990, the Lebanese Civil War came to a close and a return to political normalcy in Lebanon began. With peace among all factions in Lebanon, the rebuilding of the country and its capital, Beirut, began. 1990 Nepalese revolution, a multiparty movement against the one-party Panchayat rule in Nepal. It led to the end of absolute monarchy in Nepal and the restoration of democracy. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian Prime Minister Yasser Arafat agree to the Israeli–Palestinian peace process at the culmination of the Oslo Accords, negotiated by the United States President, Bill Clinton, on 13 September 1993. By signing the Oslo accords, the Palestine Liberation Organization recognized Israel's right to exist. At the same time, Israel permitted the creation of an autonomous Palestinian National Authority consisting of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, which was implemented in 1994. Israeli military forces withdrew from these Palestinian territories in compliance with the accord, which marked the end of the First Intifada (a period of violence between Palestinian Arab militants and Israeli armed forces from 1987 to 1993)."
1990s,"The Palestinian National Authority was created in 1994 following the Oslo Accords, giving Palestinian Arab people official autonomy over the Gaza Strip and West Bank, though not official independence from Israel. On 4 November 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing extremist who opposed the signing of the Oslo Accords. North Yemen and South Yemen merged to form Yemen in 1991. Lee Kuan Yew resigned as the Prime Minister of Singapore on 28 November 1990, a position he had held since 1959, to Goh Chok Tong. Lee remained in the cabinet as Senior Minister. In July 1994, North Korean leader Kim Il-sung died, having ruled the country since its founding in 1948. His son Kim Jong-il, who succeeded him, took over a nation on the brink of complete economic collapse. Famine had caused a significant number of deaths in the late 1990s, and North Korea gained a reputation for being an important hub of money laundering, counterfeiting, and weapons proliferation. The country's ability to produce and sell nuclear weapons became a prominent concern in the international community. In 1990, Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy in Burma won a majority of seats in the first free election conducted in 30 years. But the SPDC refused to relinquish power, beginning a peaceful struggle that began in the 1990s and continued for several decades, primarily fueled by Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters to demand the end of military rule. Indonesian president Suharto resigned after ruling for 32 years (1966–1998), following the fall of Suharto and the beginning reform era."
1990s,"In India, the former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated on 21 May 1991 by the Tamil Tigers, beginning a period of economic liberalization led by new Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. After democratic reforms and steady economic growth in the four Asia-Pacific MNNAs by the United States and Canada, after the Revolutions of 1989. In the Philippines, following the People Power Revolution of 1986 under the Corazon Aquino presidency until 1992, democratic reforms and economic policies implemented by two Presidents were elected by Fidel V. Ramos in 1992, and Joseph Estrada in 1998. South Korea and Taiwan became developed countries, and two of the Four Asian Tigers in the 1990s. Following democratic reforms in 1988, neoliberal policies were implemented by President Kim Young-sam (South Korea) and President Lee Teng-hui (Taiwan), both who led their countries during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Japan saw eight different prime ministers serve during the 1990s in what was at first called the ""Lost Decade"" but later became referred to as the ""Lost Decades of the Heisei Era"". These included Morihiro Hosokawa, who won the 1993 Japanese general election and formed an opposition coalition until 1996. The improvement in relations between NATO countries and the former members of the Warsaw Pact led to the end of the Cold War, both in Europe and other parts of the world. German reunification – on 3 October 1990, East and West Germany reunified as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall. After reintegrating their economic structure and provincial governments, Germany focused on the modernization of the formerly communist East. People brought up in socialist East Germany became integrated with those living in capitalist West Germany."
1990s,"Margaret Thatcher, who had been the United Kingdom's Prime Minister since 1979, resigned as Prime Minister on 22 November 1990 after being challenged for leadership of the Conservative Party by Michael Heseltine. This was because of widespread opposition to the introduction of the controversial Community Charge, and the fact that her key allies such as Nigel Lawson and Geoffrey Howe resigned over the deeply sensitive issues of the Maastricht Treaty and Margaret Thatcher's resistance to Britain joining the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Less than two years later, on the infamous Black Wednesday of September 1992, the pound sterling crashed out of the system after the pound fell below the agreed exchange rate with the Deutsche Mark. John Major replaced Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1990. The Perestroika (restructuring) of the Soviet Union destabilized, leading to nationalist and separatist demagogues gaining popularity. Boris Yeltsin, then chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Russia, resigned from the Communist Party and became the opposition leader against Mikhail Gorbachev. The Communist Party lost its status as the governing force of the country and was banned after a coup attempt by Communist hardliners attempted to revert the effects of Gorbachev's policies. Yeltsin's counter-revolution was victorious, and on 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned from the presidency, which led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin became president of the Soviet Union's successor, the Russian Federation, and presided over a period of political unrest, economic crisis, and social anarchy. On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin resigned, leaving Vladimir Putin as acting president."
1990s,"The European Union was formed in 1992 under the Maastricht Treaty. The Downing Street Declaration, signed on 15 December 1993 by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, John Major, and the Taoiseach of Ireland, Albert Reynolds at the British Prime Minister's office in 10 Downing Street, affirmed that (1) the right of the people of Ireland to self-determination, and (2) that Northern Ireland would be transferred to the Republic of Ireland from the United Kingdom only if a majority of its population was in favour of such a move. It included, as part of the perspective of the so-called ""Irish dimension,"" the principle of consent that the people of the island of Ireland had the exclusive right to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent. The latter statement, which later would become one of the points of the Good Friday Agreement, was key to producing a positive change of attitude by the Republicans towards a negotiated settlement. The joint declaration also pledged the governments to seek a peaceful constitutional settlement and promised that parties linked with paramilitaries (such as Sinn Féin) could take part in the talks so long as they abandoned violence. The IRA agreed to a truce in 1994. This marked the beginning of the end of 25 years of violence between the IRA and the United Kingdom and the start of political negotiations. Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 following a general election. The Belfast Agreement (a.k.a. the Good Friday Agreement) was signed by the U.K. and Irish politicians on 10 April 1998, declaring a joint commitment to a peaceful resolution of the territorial dispute between Ireland and the United Kingdom over Northern Ireland. The 1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum was held on 22 May 1998, with majority approval."
1990s,"The National Assembly for Wales was established following the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum, in which a majority of voters approved the creation of the National Assembly for Wales. In September 1997, the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favor of the establishment of a new Scottish Parliament. The 1990s saw a trend in frequent and more devastating natural disasters, breaking many previous records. Although the 1990s was designated by the United Nations as an International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction as part of its program to prevent losses due to disasters, disasters would go on to cause a record-breaking US$608 billion worth of damage—more than the past four decades combined. The most prominent natural disasters of the decade include: Hurricane Andrew striking South Florida in August 1992, the crippling super storm of March 1993 along the Eastern Seaboard, the devastating 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, the Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe, Japan in January 1995, the Blizzard of 1996 in the eastern United States, the US drought of 1999, the deadly Hurricane Mitch which struck Central America in October 1998, the destructive Oklahoma tornado outbreak in May 1999, the August 1999 İzmit earthquake in Turkey, and the September 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan. A magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit the Philippines on 16 July 1990 and killed around 1000 people in Baguio. After 600 years of inactivity, Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted and devastated Zambales and Pampanga in June 1991. July 1995 – Midwestern United States heat wave – An unprecedented heat wave strikes the Midwestern United States for most of the month. Temperatures peak at 106 °F (41 °C), and remain above 94 °F (34 °C) in the afternoon for 5 straight days. At least 739 people died in Chicago alone."
1990s,"Hurricane Georges downed trees in Key West along the old houseboat row on South Roosevelt Blvd. Hurricane Georges made landfall in at least seven different countries (Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, the United States and Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth of the United States) – more than any other hurricane since Hurricane Inez of the 1966 season. The total estimated costs were $60 billion (about $110 billion in 2022). September 1996 – Hurricane Fran made landfall in North Carolina, causing significant damage throughout the entire state. Hurricane Iniki hit the island of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands on 11 September 1992, making it one of the costliest hurricanes on record in the eastern Pacific. A flood hits the Red River Valley in 1997 becoming the most severe flood since 1826. In December 1999, torrential rains and flash floods killed tens of thousands of Venezuelans living in the state of Vargas in a natural disaster known as the Vargas tragedy. Gulf War oil spill: Resulting from actions taken during the Gulf War in 1991 by the Iraq military, the oil spill caused considerable damage to wildlife in the Persian Gulf, especially in areas surrounding Kuwait and Iraq. July 11, 1991: A Nationair Douglas DC-8, chartered by Nigeria Airways, caught fire and crashed in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, killing 261 people. December 15, 1991: The Egyptian ferry Salem Express sinks in the Red Sea, killing more than 450 people. October 4, 1992: El Al Flight 1862, a Boeing 747 cargo airplane heading to Tel Aviv, suffered physical engine separation of both right-wing engines just after taking off from Schiphol and crashed into an apartment building in the Bijlmer neighbourhood of Amsterdam while attempting to return to the airport. A total of 43 people were killed, including the plane's crew of three and a ""non-revenue passenger."" Several others were injured."
1990s,"July 26, 1993: Asiana Airlines Flight 733 crashed into Mt. Ungeo in Haenam, South Korea, killing 68 people. April 26, 1994: China Airlines Flight 140, an Airbus A300, crashed just as it was about to land at Nagoya Airfield, Japan, killing 264 and leaving only seven survivors. September 8, 1994: USAir Flight 427 crashed near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing 132 people. September 28, 1994: The car ferry MS Estonia sinks in the Baltic Sea, killing 852 people. June 29, 1995: The Sampoong Department Store collapses in Seoul, South Korea, killing 502 people. December 20, 1995: American Airlines Flight 965, a Boeing 757, hit a mountain in Colombia at night, killing 159 people. July 17, 1996: Trans World Airlines Flight 800, a Boeing 747-131 exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, killing 230. November 12, 1996: A Saudia Boeing 747 and a Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 collided over the town of Charkhi Dadri, outside New Delhi, India, killing 349.

October 31, 1999: EgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing 767, crashed off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, killing 217. Many countries, institutions, companies, and organizations were prosperous during the 1990s. High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade during the Great Moderation. However, in the former Soviet Union, GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed, and some capital flight occurred."
1990s,"In 1993, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was updated to include the creation of the World Trade Organization, with the 76 existing GATT members and European Communities becoming the founding members of the World Trade Organization on 1 January 1995. Opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in Seattle in December 1999. The anti-globalization protests in the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 in Seattle began on 30 November 1999. This marked the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests in the first decade of the 21st century and increasing hostility to neoliberalism. U.S. inflation moderated, beginning in 1990 at 5.39%, falling to a low of 1.55% in 1998 and rising slightly to 2.19% in 1999. The G20 or Group of Twenty formed on the 26 September 1999. The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States and Canada, largely because of the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries. The U.S. and Canadian economies experienced their longest period of peacetime economic expansion, beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The New York Stock Exchange stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001. After the 1992 boom of the US stock market, Alan Greenspan coined the phrase ""irrational exuberance"", a reference to the overenthusiam of investors that typified the trading of this period, and warned of overvaluation of assets and the stock market generally. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which phases out the trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada, was signed into law by President Bill Clinton."
1990s,"In the People's Republic of China, the government announced the major privatization of state-owned industries in September 1997. China entered the 1990s in a turbulent period due to the aftermath of both the Tiananmen Square Massacre and hardline politicians' efforts to rein in private enterprise and attempt to revive old-fashioned propaganda campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992 Deng Xiaoping travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into Maoism. Afterward, China recovered and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. Despite this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin launched a brutal crackdown against the Falun Gong religious sect in 1999. Deng Xiaoping died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility. Financial crisis hits East and Southeast Asian countries between 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues into 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade. In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the county experienced an economic downturn after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, ending the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had previously enjoyed. Less affluent nations such as India, Malaysia, and Vietnam also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in Third World regions that were once the ""frontlines"" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia."
1990s,"By 1990, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms were causing major inflation and economic chaos. A coup attempt by hardliners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence by 1991, and Gorbachev resigned from office on Christmas. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by Boris Yeltsin, and would face severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the support of the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, Yeltsin stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin. Russian financial crisis in the 1990s resulted in mass hyperinflation and prompted economic intervention from the International Monetary Fund and western countries to help Russia's economy recover. The first McDonald's restaurant opened in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President Boris Yeltsin attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist free market economy and a move towards adopting elements of Western culture. Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and broader adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by increased oil production. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the Cold War led to economic development and higher living standards for many citizens."
1990s,"Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the 1990s. However, problems including the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties associated with German reunification led to sluggish growth in these countries. However, the French and German economies improved in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of Spain, Scandinavia and former Eastern Bloc countries accelerated at rapid speed during the decade. Unemployment rates were low due to many having experienced a deep recession at the start of the decade. After the early 1990s recession, the United Kingdom and Ireland experienced rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continued throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the Late 2000s recession, marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history. Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania saw economic growth in the late 1990s. With the creation of the European Union (EU), there is freedom of movement between member states, such as the 1992 and 1995 free trade agreements. The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out the former national currencies of EU countries. A Latin American common market, Mercosur, was established in 1991. Mercosur's origins are linked to the discussions for the constitution of a regional economic market for Latin America, which go back to the treaty that established the Latin American Free Trade Association in 1960, which was succeeded by the Latin American Integration Association in the 1980s. On 6 August 1991, CERN, a pan-European organization for particle research, publicized the new World Wide Web project.[44] Although the basic applications and guidelines that make the Internet possible had existed for almost two decades, the network did not gain a public face until the 1990s."
1990s,"The 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology. Between 1990 and 1997, household personal computer ownership in the US rose from 15% to 35%. Cell phones of the early-1990s and earlier ones were very large, lacked extra features, and were used by only a few percent of the population of even the wealthiest nations. Only a few million people used online services in 1990, and the World Wide Web, which would have a significant impact on technology for many decades, had only just been invented. The first web browser went online in 1993. By 2001, more than 50% of some Western countries had Internet access, and more than 25% had cell phone access. The 1990s began with a recession that dampened car sales. General Motors suffered huge losses because of an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new Saturn division fared well, Oldsmobile fell sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful. Cars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on. Chrysler ran into financial troubles as it entered the 1990s. Like GM, the Chrysler too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling minivans) that were largely based on the aging K-car platform. In 1992, chairman Lee Iacocca retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new LH platform and ""Cab-Forward"" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized Dodge Ram in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, Daimler-Benz (the parent company of Mercedes-Benz) merged with Chrysler. "
1990s,"The following year, it was decided to retire Plymouth, which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. Ford continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the second and third generations of the Ford Taurus being named the best-selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the Toyota Camry starting in 1997, which became the best-selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, with the first model being sold in 1991. Ford's Explorer became the best-selling SUV on the market, outselling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee. Japanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The Honda Accord vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands Lexus and Infiniti began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991 and outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the decade's second half. Many manufacturers that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Fabrication during the 1990s became gradually rounder and ovoid, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as airbags and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars. The 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would continue until the Great Recession of the late 2000s/early 2010s. At the beginning of the decade, sustainable development and environmental protection became serious issues for governments and the international community. In 1987, the publication of the Brundtland Report by the United Nations paved the way to establish an environmental governance. In 1992, the Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries committed to protect the environment, signing a Convention on Biological Diversity."
1990s,"The prevention of the destruction of the tropical rainforests of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s and has continued and accelerated in its prominence. The Chernobyl disaster had significant impact on public opinion at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century. Well into the 1990s, several environmental NGOs helped improve environmental awareness among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was Greenpeace, which did not hesitate to lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drew attention to the large deforestation of the Amazon rainforest during the period. Global warming as an aspect of climate change also became a major concern, and the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the UNFCCC held annual summits on climate change, leading to the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in December 1997, a binding agreement signed by several developed countries. The 1989 EPA total ban on asbestos was overturned in 1991. In 1996, (Anderson, et al. v. Pacific Gas & Electric, file BCV 00300) alleged contamination of drinking water with hexavalent chromium and the case was settled for (US) $333 million, a new record for a direct-action lawsuit. Anita Hill and other women testify before the United States Congress on being sexually harassed by Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Thomas was narrowly confirmed by the United States Senate, but Hill's testimony, and the testimony of other harassed women, begins a national debate on the issue. Record numbers of women are elected to high office in the United States in 1992, the ""Year of the Woman."""
1990s,"In 1992, Hurricane Andrew made landfall in Florida and Louisiana, causing widespread destruction and leaving thousands homeless. With sustained winds of up to 165 mph, the Category 5 storm caused over $25 billion in damages. The aftermath of the hurricane was devastating, with many people left without power, water, or basic necessities. In total, 65 people lost their lives, making Hurricane Andrew one of the deadliest hurricanes in U.S. history. The Northridge earthquake struck the Los Angeles area in 1994 and was one of the most destructive earthquakes in U.S. history. The 6.7 magnitude earthquake caused widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure, with the estimated cost of damages reaching over $20 billion. Over 50 people lost their lives, and many more were injured. The earthquake highlighted the need for better earthquake-resistant building designs in the region. The El Niño of 1998 was one of the strongest on record and caused significant impacts across the globe. The warming of ocean waters led to heavy rainfall and flooding in many regions, including California, South America, and Indonesia. The flooding caused billions of dollars in damages and displaced millions of people. The El Niño also had major impacts on the world's fisheries, leading to the collapse of many fish populations. The Kobe earthquake of 1995 was a devastating event that struck the city of Kobe, Japan. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.9 and caused widespread destruction, including the collapse of buildings and infrastructure. Over 6,000 people lost their lives, and the economic impact of the earthquake was estimated to be over $100 billion. The Kobe earthquake highlighted the need for better disaster preparedness and response in Japan."
1990s,"The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 was one of the largest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century. The eruption spewed ash and gas into the atmosphere, leading to a temporary cooling of global temperatures. The eruption caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, and tens of thousands of people were displaced from their homes. The economic impact of the eruption was estimated to be over $700 million. The Izmit earthquake of 1999 was a devastating event that struck the Marmara region of Turkey.

1990s,"Mermaids are mythical creatures that have captured the imagination of people throughout history. These half-human, half-fish beings are often depicted as beautiful and alluring, with the ability to control the seas and the creatures that inhabit them. Mermaids feature in the folklore of many cultures, from ancient Greece to modern-day Japan, and their legends continue to inspire literature, art, and film. In Greek mythology, the sirens were a group of mermaids who lured sailors to their doom with their enchanting voices. The sirens were said to live on rocky islands, and their songs were so beautiful that sailors would become entranced and crash their ships on the rocks.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted in 1992 and marked a significant milestone in international efforts to address climate change. The convention was signed by 154 countries, including the United States, and aimed to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 and was an extension of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The protocol committed developed countries to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels by 2012. The Kyoto Protocol marked a significant step forward in international efforts to address climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988 and played a significant role in shaping international understanding of climate change in the 1990s. The IPCC's reports were instrumental in shaping the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, and have been widely cited by policymakers, scientists, and the media. In 1998, a mass coral bleaching event occurred in the Indian Ocean, resulting in the loss of over 70% of coral in some areas. The event highlighted the potential impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems, and raised concerns about the need for better conservation measures."
1990s,"The First Assessment Report of the IPCC was published in 1990 and provided the first comprehensive assessment of the scientific understanding of climate change. The report concluded that ""emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases"" and that ""climate change is likely to have significant ecological, social, and economic impacts."" The Second Assessment Report of the IPCC was published in 1995 and provided an updated assessment of the scientific understanding of climate change. The report concluded that ""the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate."" The Third Assessment Report of the IPCC was published in 2001 and provided an updated assessment of the scientific understanding of climate change. The report concluded that ""most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities."" In 1995, a heat wave struck Chicago, resulting in over 700 deaths. The event highlighted the potential impacts of climate change on public health, and raised awareness about the need for better preparedness and response measures in the face of extreme weather events. The 1998 El Niño event was one of the strongest on record and had significant impacts on weather patterns around the world. The event highlighted the potential for climate change to exacerbate extreme weather events, and raised concerns about the need for better adaptation measures. The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines released large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, resulting in a temporary cooling effect on global temperatures. The event highlighted the potential for volcanic activity to influence global climate, and raised questions about the relationship between natural and human-induced climate change."
1990s,"The 1997-1998 Super El Niño event was one of the most powerful on record and had significant impacts on weather patterns around the world. The event contributed to droughts, floods, and wildfires, and highlighted the potential for extreme weather events to become more frequent and severe due to climate change. In 1993, a series of floods struck the Midwest United States, causing over $15 billion in damages and resulting in 50 deaths. The event highlighted the potential for climate change to exacerbate extreme weather events, and raised concerns about the need for better adaptation and resilience measures. The 1999 Seattle World Trade Organization protests brought international attention to the issue of climate change and the role of international trade in exacerbating greenhouse gas emissions. The protests highlighted the need for greater collaboration between governments, businesses, and civil society in addressing climate change. Karla Homolka was arrested with her husband, Paul Bernardo, in 1993. Both sexually tortured and killed their victims. Their first victim was Karla's 15-year-old sister, Tammy Homolka. The second and third victims were Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French. Karla told the investigators that she reluctantly did what Paul told her to do because he was abusive, and was given a plea deal. She was sentenced to 12 years in prison (10 years for Mahaffy and French, and two years for Tammy). Later, investigators discovered the crime videotapes, proving that Karla was a willing participant. But by that time the deal had already been made. In 1995, Paul was sentenced to life in prison. Karla was released from prison in 2005. Massive immigration wave of Jews from the Commonwealth of Independent States to Israel – With the end of the Soviet Union, Israel faced a mass influx of Russian Jews, many of whom had high expectations the country was unable to meet. Israel also came under an Iraqi missile attack during the Gulf War but acquiesced to US pressure not to retaliate militarily, which could have disrupted the US-Arab alliance. The US and Netherlands then rushed anti-missile batteries to Israel to defend the country against missile attacks."
2000s,"The 2000s (pronounced ""two-thousands""; shortened to the '00s and known as the aughts or noughties) was a decade that began on January 1, 2000, and ended on December 31, 2009. The early part of the decade saw the long predicted breakthrough of economic giants in Asia, like India and China, which had double-digit growth during nearly the whole decade. It is also benefited from an economic boom, which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force. The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the crisis in housing and credit in the United States in late 2007 and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions. The outbreak of this global financial crisis sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world. The decade saw the rise of internet, which grew from covering 6.7% to 25.7% of the world population. This contributed to globalization during the decade, which allowed faster communication among people around the world, social networking sites arose as a new way for people to stay in touch from distant locations, as long as they had an internet connection. Myspace was the most popular social networking website until June 2009, when Facebook overtook it in number of American users. E-mail continued to be popular throughout the decade and began to replace ""snail mail"" as the primary way of sending letters and other messages to people in distant locations, though it had existed since 1971. Google, YouTube, Ask.com and Wikipedia emerged to become among the top 10 most popular websites. "
2000s,"Amazon overtook eBay as the most-visited e-commerce site in 2008. AOL significantly declined in popularity throughout the decade, falling from being the most popular website to no longer being within the top 10. Excite and Lycos fell outside the top 10, and MSN fell from the second to sixth most popular site, though it quadrupled its monthly visits. Yahoo maintained relatively stable popularity, remaining the most popular website for most of the decade. The war on terror and War in Afghanistan began after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The International Criminal Court was formed in 2002. In 2003, a United States-led coalition invaded Iraq, and the Iraq War led to the end of Saddam Hussein's rule as Iraqi President and the Ba'ath Party in Iraq. Al-Qaeda and affiliated Islamist militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. The Second Congo War, the deadliest conflict since World War II, ended in July 2003. Further wars that ended included the Algerian Civil War, the Angolan Civil War, the Sierra Leone Civil War, the Second Liberian Civil War, the Nepalese Civil War, and the Sri Lankan Civil War. Wars that began included the conflict in the Niger Delta, the Houthi insurgency in Yemen, and the Mexican Drug War. Climate change and global warming became common concerns in the 2000s. Prediction tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored organizations such as the IPCC gained influence, and studies such as the Stern report influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of countering climate change. The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. "
2000s,"The WMO's findings were later echoed by the NASA and the NOAA. Usage of computer-generated imagery became more widespread in films produced during the 2000s, especially with the success of 2001's Shrek. Anime films gained more exposure outside Japan with the release of Spirited Away. December 2009's Avatar became the highest-grossing film. Documentary and mockumentary films, such as March of the Penguins, Super Size Me, Borat and Surf's Up, were popular in the 2000s. 2004's Fahrenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore was the highest grossing documentary of all time. Online films became popular, and conversion to digital cinema started. Video game consoles released in this decade included the PlayStation 2, the Xbox, the GameCube, the Wii, the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360; while portable video game consoles included Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Wii Sports was the decade's best-selling console video game, while New Super Mario Bros. was the decade's best-selling portable video game. J. K. Rowling was the best-selling author in the decade overall thanks to the Harry Potter book series, although she did not pen the best-selling individual book, being second to The Da Vinci Code. Eminem was named the music artist of the decade by Billboard. During this decade, the world population grew from 6.1 to 6.9 billion people. Approximately 1.35 billion people were born, and 550 million people died. In December 2009, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 having occurred in this decade. "
2000s,"Orthographically, the decade can be written as the ""2000s"" or the ""'00s"". In the English-speaking world, a name for the decade wasn't immediately accepted as it had been for other decades ('80s, '90s), but usage eventually settled on ""aughts"" (US) or ""noughties"" (UK). Other possibilities included ""two-thousands"", ""twenty hundreds"", ""ohs"", ""oh ohs"", ""double ohs"", ""zeros"", and ""double zeros"". The years of the decade can be referred to as '01, '02, etc., pronounced oh-one, oh-two, etc. The war on terror and War in Afghanistan began after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The International Criminal Court was formed in 2002. In 2003 a United States-led coalition invaded Iraq, and the Iraq War led to the end of Saddam Hussein's rule as Iraqi President and the Ba'ath Party in Iraq. Al-Qaeda and affiliated Islamist militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. These acts included the 2004 Madrid train bombings, 7/7 London bombings in 2005, and the Mumbai attacks related to al-Qaeda in 2008. The European Union expanded its sanctions amid Iran's failure to comply with its transparency obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and United Nations resolutions. The war on terror generated extreme controversy around the world, with questions regarding the justification for certain U.S. actions leading to a loss of support for the American government, both in and outside the United States. The additional armed conflict occurred in the Middle East, including between Israel and Hezbollah, then with Israel and Hamas. The most significant loss of life due to natural disasters came from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which caused a tsunami that killed around one quarter-million people and displaced well over a million others."
2000s,"War on terror (2001–present) – refers to several ideological, military, and diplomatic campaigns aimed at putting an end to international terrorism by preventing groups defined by the U.S. and its allies as terrorist (mostly Islamist groups such as al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas) from posing a threat to the U.S. and its allies, and by putting an end to state sponsorship of terrorism. The campaigns were launched by the United States, with support from NATO and other allies, following the September 11 attacks that were carried out by al-Qaeda. Today the term has become mostly associated with Bush administration-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) – In 2001, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Canada, and Australia invaded Afghanistan seeking to oust the Taliban and find al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden. In 2011, the US government claimed Navy Seals had killed Bin Laden and buried his body at sea. Fatalities of coalition troops: 1,553 (2001 to 2009). Iraq War (2003–2011) – In 2003, the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia, and Poland invaded and occupied Iraq. Claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction at its disposal were later found to be unproven.[22] The war, which ended the rule of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party, also led to violence against the coalition forces and between many Sunni and Shia Iraqi groups and al-Qaeda operations in Iraq. Casualties of the Iraq War: Approximately 110,600 between March 2003 to April 2009. Hussein was eventually sentenced to death and hanged on December 30, 2006. 2006 Lebanon War (summer 2006) – took place in southern Lebanon and northern Israel. The principal parties were Hezbollah paramilitary forces and the Israeli military. The war that began as a military operation in response to the abduction of two Israeli reserve soldiers by the Hezbollah gradually strengthened and became a wider confrontation."
2000s,"Second Intifada (2000–2005) – After the signing of the Oslo Accords failed to bring about a Palestinian state, in September 2000, the Second Intifada (uprising) broke out, a period of intensified Palestinian-Israeli violence, which has been taking place until the present day. As a result of the significant increase of suicide bombing attacks within Israeli population centers during the first years of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, in June 2002 Israel began the construction of the West Bank Fence along the Green Line border arguing that the barrier is necessary to protect Israeli civilians from Palestinian terrorism. The significantly reduced number of incidents of suicide bombings from 2002 to 2005 has been partly attributed to the barrier.[24] The barrier's construction, which has been highly controversial, became a significant issue of contention between the two sides. The Second Intifada has caused thousands of victims on both sides, both among combatants and among civilians – The death toll, including both military and civilian, is estimated to be 5,500 Palestinians and over 1,000 Israelis, as well as 64 foreign citizens. Many Palestinians consider the Second Intifada to be a legitimate war of national liberation against foreign occupation, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a terrorist campaign. 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict – the frequent Hamas Qassam rocket and mortar fire launched from within civilian population centers in Gaza towards the Israeli southern civilian communities led to an Israeli military operation in Gaza, which had the stated aim of reducing the Hamas rocket attacks and stopping the arms smuggling into the Gaza Strip. Throughout the conflict, Hamas further intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against Israel, hitting civilian targets and reaching major Israeli cities Beersheba and Ashdod, for the first time. The intense urban warfare in densely populated Gaza combined with the use of massive firepower by the Israeli side and the intensified Hamas rocket attacks towards populated Israeli civilian targets led to a high toll on the Palestinian side and among civilians."
2000s,"The Second Congo War (1998–2003) – took place mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The widest interstate war in modern African history, it directly involved nine African nations, as well as about twenty armed groups. It earned the epithet of ""Africa's World War"" and the ""Great War of Africa."" An estimated 3.8 million people died, mostly from starvation and disease brought about by the deadliest conflict since World War II. Millions more were displaced from their homes or sought asylum in neighboring countries. 2008 South Ossetia war – Russia invaded Georgia in response to Georgian aggression towards civilians and attack on South Ossetia. Both Russia and Georgia were condemned internationally for their actions. The Second Chechen War (1999–2000) – the war was launched by the Russian Federation on August 26, 1999, in response to the invasion of Dagestan and the Russian apartment bombings, which were blamed on the Chechens. During the war, Russian forces largely recaptured the separatist region of Chechnya. The campaign largely reversed the outcome of the First Chechen War, in which the region gained de facto independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. The Eritrean–Ethiopian War came to a close in 2000. Kivu conflict (2004–2009) – armed conflict between the military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) and the Hutu Power group Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). 2009 Nigerian sectarian violence – an armed conflict between Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group, and Nigerian security forces. War in Darfur (2003–2009) – an armed conflict in the Darfur region of western Sudan. The conflict began when the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) in Darfur took up arms, accusing the government of oppressing black Africans in favor of Arabs. One side was composed mainly of the Sudanese military and the Sudanese militia group Janjaweed, recruited mostly from the Afro-Arab Abbala tribes of the northern Rizeigat region in Sudan. The other side was made up of rebel groups, notably the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army and the Justice and Equality Movement, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit ethnic groups. "
2000s,"Millions of people were displaced from their homes during the conflict. There are various estimates on the number of human casualties – Sudanese authorities claim a death toll of roughly 19,500 civilians[30] while certain non-governmental organizations, such as the Coalition for International Justice, claim that over 400,000 people have been killed during the conflict. Former U.S. President George W. Bush called the events in Darfur a genocide during his presidency. The United States Congress unanimously passed House Concurrent Resolution 467, which declared the situation in Darfur a state-sponsored genocide by the Janjaweed. In 2008, the International Criminal Court charged Omar al-Bashir with genocide for his role in the War in Darfur. Mexican Drug War (2006–present) – an armed conflict fought between rival drug cartels and government forces in Mexico. Although Mexican drug cartels, or drug trafficking organizations, have existed for quite some time, they have become more powerful since the demise of Colombia's Cali and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale illicit drug market in the United States.[40] Arrests of key cartel leaders, particularly in the Tijuana and Gulf cartels, have led to increasing drug violence as cartels fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States. Roughly more than 16,851 people in total were killed between December 2006 until November 2009. Although the Colombian State has taken back control over most of the country, narcoterrorism still causes pain in the country. Since 2008, the Internet has become a new field of battle. Facebook has gained nationwide popularity and has become the birthplace of many civil movements against narcoterrorism such as ""Colombia Soy Yo"" (I am Colombia) or ""Fundación Un Millón de Voces"" (One Million Voices Foundation), responsible for the international protests against illegal groups during the last years."
2000s,"The Colombian Armed Conflict continues causing deaths and terror in Colombia. Beginning in 1964, the FARC and ELN narcoterrorist groups were taking control of rural areas of the country by the beginning of the decade, while terrorist paramilitaries grew in other places as businesspeople and politicians thought the State would lose the war against guerrillas. However, after the failure of the peace process and the activation of Plan Colombia, Álvaro Uribe Vélez was elected president in 2002, starting a massive attack on terrorist groups, with cooperation from civil population, foreign aid and legal armed forces. The AUC paramilitary organization disbanded in 2006, while ELN guerrillas have been weakened. The Popular Liberation Army demobilized while the country's biggest terrorist group, FARC has been weakened and most of their top commanders have been killed or died during the decade. During the second half of the decade, a new criminal band has been formed by former members of AUC who did not demobilize, calling themselves Aguilas Negras. The Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002) came to an end when the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) finally laid down their arms. More than two million people were displaced from their homes because of the conflict (well over one-third of the population) many of whom became refugees in neighboring countries. Tens of thousands were killed during the conflict. The Sri Lankan Civil War (1983–2009) came to an end after the government defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Over 80,000 people were killed during the course of the conflict. War in North-West Pakistan (2004–present) – an armed conflict between the Pakistani Armed Forces and Islamic militants made up of local tribesmen, the Taliban, and foreign Mujahideen (Holy Warriors). It began in 2004 when tensions rooted in the Pakistani Army's search for al-Qaeda members in Pakistan's mountainous Waziristan area (in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas) escalated into armed resistance by local tribesmen. The violence has displaced 3.44 million civilians and led to more than 7,000 civilians being killed."
2000s,"The Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), once a major proxy conflict of the Cold War, the conflict ended after the anti-Communist organization UNITA disbanded to become a political party. By the time the 27-year conflict was formally brought to an end, an estimated 500,000 people had been killed. Shia insurgency in Yemen (2004–present) – a civil war in the Sada'a Governorate of Yemen. It began after the Shia Zaidiyyah sect launched an uprising against the Yemeni government. The Yemeni government has accused Iran of directing and financing the insurgency. Thousands of rebels and civilians have been killed during the conflict. Somalia War (2006–2009) – involved largely Ethiopian and Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces who fought against the Somali Islamist umbrella group, the Islamic Court Union (ICU), and other affiliated militias for control of the country. The war spawned pirates who hijacked hundreds of ships off the coast of Somalia, holding ships and crew for ransom often for months (see also Piracy in Somalia). 1.9 million people were displaced from their homes during the conflict and the number of civilian casualties during the conflict is estimated at 16,724. Somali Civil War (2009–present) – involved largely the forces of the Somali Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) assisted by African Union peacekeeping troops, whom fought against various militant Islamist factions for control of the country. The violence has displaced thousands of people residing in Mogadishu, the nation's capital. 1,739 people in total were killed between January 1, 2009, and January 1, 2010."
2000s,"Conflict in the Niger Delta (2004–present) – an ongoing conflict in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The conflict was caused due to the tensions between the foreign oil corporations and a number of the Niger Delta's minority ethnic groups who felt they were being exploited, particularly the Ogoni and the Ijaw. The competition for oil wealth has led to an endless violence cycle between innumerable ethnic groups, causing the militarization of nearly the entire region that was occupied by militia groups as well as Nigerian military and the forces of the Nigerian Police. Algerian Civil War (1991–2002) – the conflict effectively ended with a government victory, following the surrender of the Islamic Salvation Army and the 2002 defeat of the Armed Islamic Group. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people were killed during the course of the conflict. Chadian Civil War (1998–2002) – involved the Movement for Justice and Democracy in Chad (MDJT) rebels that skirmished periodically with government troops in the Tibesti region, resulting in hundreds of civilian, government, and rebel casualties. Chadian Civil War (2005–2010) – involved Chadian government forces and several Chadian rebel groups. The Government of Chad estimated in January 2006 that 614 Chadian citizens had been killed in cross-border raids. The fighting still continues despite several attempts to reach agreements. Nepalese Civil War (1996–2006) – the conflict ended with a peace agreement was reached between the government and the Maoist party in which it was set that the Maoists would take part in the new government in return for surrendering their weapons to the UN. It is estimated that more than 12,700 people were killed during the course of the conflict."
2000s,"Second Liberian Civil War (1999–2003) – The conflict began in 1999 when a rebel group Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), with support from the Government of Guinea, took over northern Liberia through a coup. In early 2003, a different rebel group, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia, emerged in the south.

(see 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis). Since 2005, Iran's nuclear program has become the subject of contention with the Western world due to suspicions that Iran could divert the civilian nuclear technology to a weapons program. This has led the UN Security Council to impose sanctions against Iran on select companies linked to this program, thus furthering its economic isolation on the international scene. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence said in February 2009 that Iran would not realistically be able to a get a nuclear weapon until 2013, if it chose to develop one. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq over allegations that its leader Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction including chemical and biological weapons or was in the process of creating them. None were found, spawning multiple theories. North Korea successfully performed two nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. Operation Orchard – during the operation, Israel bombed what was believed to be a Syrian nuclear reactor on September 6, 2007, which was thought to be built with the aid of North Korea. The White House and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later declared that American intelligence indicated the site was a nuclear facility with a military purpose, though Syria denies this."

2000s,"Parties broadly characterised by political scientists as being right-wing populist soar throughout the 2000s, in the wake of increasing anti-Islam and anti-immigration sentiment in most Western European countries.[84] By 2010, such parties (albeit often significant differences between them) were present in the national parliaments of Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Italy and Greece. In Austria, Italy and Switzerland, the Freedom Party of Austria, Lega Nord and Swiss People's Party, respectively, were at times also part of the national governments, and in Denmark, the Danish People's Party tolerated a right-liberal minority government from 2001 throughout the decade.

2000s,"The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom in 2001 caused a crisis in British agriculture and tourism. This epizootic saw 2,000 cases of the disease in farms across most of the British countryside. Over 10 million sheep and cattle were killed. Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Hong Kong, with 8,273 cases and 775 deaths worldwide (9.6% fatality) according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Within weeks, SARS spread from Hong Kong to infect individuals in 37 countries in early 2003. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: the Office for National Statistics reported 1,629 MRSA-related deaths in England and Wales during 2005, indicating a MRSA-related mortality rate half the rate of that in the United States for 2005, even though the figures from the British source were explained to be high because of ""improved levels of reporting, possibly brought about by the continued high public profile of the disease"" during the time of the 2005 United Kingdom General Election. MRSA is thought to have caused 1,652 deaths in 2006 in UK up from 51 in 1993. The 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) flu pandemic was also considered a natural disaster. On October 25, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama officially declared H1N1 a national emergency.[98] Despite President Obama's concern, a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in October 2009 that an overwhelming majority of New Jerseyans (74%) were not very worried or not at all worried about contracting the H1N1 flu virus. A study conducted in coordination with the University of Michigan Health Service is scheduled for publication in the December 2009 American Journal of Roentgenology warning that H1N1 flu can cause pulmonary embolism, surmised as a leading cause of death in this current pandemic. "
2000s,"The study authors suggest physician evaluation via contrast enhanced CT scans for the presence of pulmonary emboli when caring for patients diagnosed with respiratory complications from a ""severe"" case of the H1N1 flu.

The most significant evolution of the 2000s in the economic landscape was the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant China, whose GDP grew from 1.21 trillion to 5.1 trillion (in 2022 USD). To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom (growing from 438.39 billion to 1.34 trillion) which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force. The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the crisis in housing and credit in the United States in late 2007, and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions. The outbreak of this global financial crisis sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world. On October 9, 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at the record level of 14,164.53. Two days later on October 11, the Dow would trade at its highest intra-day level ever, at the 14,198.10 mark. In what would normally take many years to accomplish; numerous reasons were cited for the Dow's extremely rapid rise from the 11,000 level in early 2006, to the 14,000 level in late 2007. They included future possible takeovers and mergers, healthy earnings reports particularly in the tech sector, and moderate inflationary numbers; fueling speculation the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates. Roughly on par with the 2000 record when adjusted for inflation, this represented the final high of the cyclical bull. The index closed 2007 at 13,264.82, a level it would not surpass for nearly five years."

2000s,"The removal of trade and investment barriers, the growth of domestic markets, artificially low currencies, the proliferation of education, the rapid development of high tech and information systems industries and the growth of the world economy lead to a significant growth of offshore outsourcing during the decade as many multinational corporations significantly increased subcontracting of manufacturing (and increasingly, services) across national boundaries in developing countries and particularly in China and India, due to many benefits and mainly because the two countries which are the two most populous countries in the world provide huge pools from which to find talent and as because both countries are low cost sourcing countries. As a result of this growth, many of these developing countries accumulated capital and started investing abroad. Other countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Brazil and Russia, benefited from increased demand for their mineral and energy resources that global growth generated. The hollowing out of manufacturing was felt in Japan and parts of the United States and Europe which had not been able to develop successful innovative industries. Opponents point out that the practice of offshore outsourcing by countries with higher wages leads to the reduction of their own domestic employment and domestic investment. As a result, many customer service jobs as well as jobs in the information technology sectors (data processing, computer programming, and technical support) in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have been or are potentially affected. While global trade rose in the decade (partially driven by China's entry into the WTO in 2001), there was little progress in the multilateral trading system. International trade continued to expand during the decade as emerging economies and developing countries, in particular China and South-Asian countries, benefited low wages costs and most often undervalued currencies. However, global negotiations to reduce tariffs did not make much progress, as member countries of the World Trade Organization did not succeed in finding agreements to stretch the extent of free trade."

2000s,"Certainly, Vladimir Lenin was a Russian revolutionary and politician who led the Bolshevik Party to victory in the Russian Revolution of 1917. He was the first head of the Soviet Union and played a central role in the founding and development of the Soviet state. Lenin's ideas and theories of Marxism, known as Leninism, have had a significant impact on the development of communism and socialist theory around the world. Lenin's policies included the nationalization of industry and land, the establishment of a planned economy, and the creation of the Red Army to defend the newly formed Soviet state. He also implemented the New Economic Policy, which allowed for a limited amount of market-oriented practices in order to stimulate economic growth. Lenin's leadership was characterized by his pragmatic approach to politics and his willingness to use force to achieve his goals. He believed that a revolution was necessary to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a socialist state, and he was willing to use violence and repression to achieve this end. Lenin's legacy continues to be debated today, with some seeing him as a visionary leader who laid the foundation for a more just and equal society, while others view him as a ruthless dictator who was responsible for the deaths of millions of people. Regardless of one's view of Lenin, there is no denying his significant impact on world history and the development of communism and socialist theory. For a time, geopolitical events and natural disasters indirectly related to the global oil market had strong short-term effects on oil prices. These events and disasters included North Korean missile tests, the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, worries over Iranian nuclear plants in 2006 and Hurricane Katrina. By 2008, such pressures appeared to have an insignificant impact on oil prices given the onset of the global recession. The recession caused demand for energy to shrink in late 2008 and early 2009 and the price plunged as well. However, it surged back in May 2009, bringing it back to November 2008 levels"
2000s,"Certainly, Karl Marx was a German philosopher, economist, and political theorist who is best known for his contributions to the development of communism and socialism. Marx's ideas have had a profound impact on the development of political and economic theory around the world. Marx's most famous work, ""The Communist Manifesto,"" was written with Friedrich Engels and outlines the basic tenets of communism, including the need for a classless society, the abolition of private property, and the establishment of a socialist state. Marx also wrote extensively on political economy, arguing that capitalism was inherently unstable and would eventually collapse due to its internal contradictions. Marx's theories have been used to justify a wide range of political movements and ideologies, including communism, socialism, and Marxism-Leninism. While his ideas have been heavily criticized by some, particularly in the United States, they continue to influence political and economic thought around the world. Marx's legacy is complex, with some seeing him as a visionary thinker who laid the foundation for a more just and equal society, while others view him as a dangerous radical whose ideas have led to the oppression and suffering of millions. Regardless of one's view of Marx, there is no denying his significant impact on world history and the development of political and economic theory. Many fast-growing economies throughout the world, especially in Asia, also were a major factor in the rapidly increasing demand for fossil fuels, which—along with fewer new petroleum finds, greater extraction costs, and political turmoil—forced two other trends: a soar in the price of petroleum products and a push by governments and businesses to promote the development of environmentally friendly technology (known informally as ""green"" technology). However, a side-effect of the push by some industrial nations to ""go green"" and utilize biofuels was a decrease in the supply of food and a subsequent increase in the price of the same. "
2010s,"The 2010s (pronounced ''""twenty-tens""; shortened to ""the '10s' also known as ""The Tens"" or more rarely ""The Teens"") was a decade that began on January 1, 2010, and ended on December 31, 2019. The decade began with an optimistic economical recovery from the late 2000s financial crisis. Inflation and interest rates stayed low and steady throughout the decade, Gross world product grew from 2010 to 2019, marking a period of stable recovery. The 2010s were a prosperous decade for the global economy, fueled by strong economic growth in many countries, robust consumer spending, increased investment in infrastructure, and the emergence of new technologies. Unrest in some countries—particularly in the Arab world—evolved into socioeconomic crises triggering revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Bahrain as well as civil wars in Libya, Syria, and Yemen in a regional phenomenon commonly referred to as the Arab Spring, while the resulting European debt crisis was pronounced early in the decade. Shifting social attitudes saw LGBT rights make substantial progress during the decade, particularly in developed countries. Following the economic recovery, the decade saw a musical and cultural dominance in dance-pop, electronic dance music, hipster culture and electropop. Globalization and an increased demand for variety and personalisation in the face of music streaming services such as Spotify, SoundCloud and Apple Music created many subgenres. As the decade progressed, diversity was also seen with the mainstream success of K-pop, Latin music and trap. Superhero films became box office leaders, with Avengers: Endgame becoming the highest-grossing film of all time.[note 1] Due to the high quality of many television series throughout this decade, as well as technological breakthroughs that allowed streaming, cable television, and internet outlets to provide this high quality and amount of programming, the 2010s are frequently referred to as the ""Golden Age of Television"". Cable providers saw a decline in subscriber numbers as cord cutters switched to lower cost online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and Disney+. "
2010s,"The United States continued to retain its superpower status while China, along with launching vast economic initiatives and military reforms, sought to expand its influence in the South China Sea and in Africa, solidifying its position as an emerging superpower, despite also causing series of conflicts around its frontiers. Within its border, China also enhanced its suppression and control of Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet. Global competition between China and the U.S. coalesced into a ""containment"" effort and a trade war. Elsewhere in Asia, the Koreas improved their relations after a prolonged crisis, and the War on Terror continued as a part of the U.S.'s continued military involvement in many parts of the world. The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant extremist organization in 2014 erased the borders between Syria and Iraq, resulting in a multinational intervention. In Africa, South Sudan broke away from Sudan, and mass protests and various coups d'état saw longtime strongmen deposed. In the U.S., celebrity businessman Donald Trump was elected president amid an international wave of populism and neo-nationalism. The European Union experienced a migrant crisis in the middle of the decade and the historic United Kingdom EU membership referendum followed by withdrawal negotiations during its later years. Russia attempted to assert itself in international affairs, annexing Crimea in 2014. The video game industry continued to be dominated by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft; while indie games became sustainably more popular, with Minecraft becoming the best-selling game of all time. Handheld console gaming revenue was overtaken by mobile gaming revenue in 2011. The best-selling book of this decade was Fifty Shades of Grey. Drake was named the top music artist of the decade in the US by Billboard."
2010s,"Information technology progressed, with smartphones becoming widespread. The internet grew from covering 28.9% to 54% of the world population, and also saw advancements in wireless networking devices, mobile telephony, and cloud computing. Advancements in data processing and the rollout of 4G broadband allowed data, metadata, and information to be collected and dispersed among domains at paces never before seen while online resources such as social media facilitated phenomena such as the Me Too movement, the rise of slacktivism, and online cancel culture. WikiLeaks gained international attention for publishing classified information on topics including Guantánamo Bay, Syria, the Afghan and Iraq wars, and United States diplomacy. Edward Snowden blew the whistle on global surveillance, raising awareness on the role governments and private entities have in global surveillance and information privacy. Baidu, Twitter and Instagram emerged to become among the top 10 most visited websites, while Wikipedia went from the 9th to the 5th most popular website, almost septupling its monthly visits. Yahoo significantly declined in popularity, descending from being the 1st to the 9th most popular site, with monthly visits declining by two-thirds. Google, Facebook, YouTube and Yandex maintained relatively consistent popularity and remained within the top 10 throughout the decade. Global warming became increasingly noticeable through new record temperatures in different years and extreme weather events on all continents. The CO2 concentration rose from 390 to 410 PPM over the decade. At the same time, combating pollution and climate change continued to be major concerns, as protests, initiatives, and legislation garnered substantial media attention. Particularly, the Paris Agreement (2015) was adopted, and the global climate youth movement was formed. "
2010s,"Major natural disasters included the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the Nepal earthquake of 2015, the 2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami, and the devastating hurricanes Bopha (Pablo), Haiyan (Yolanda), and Maria, as well as the 2019 European heat waves.During the decade, the world population grew from 6.9 to 7.7 billion people. There were approximately 1.4 billion births during the decade (140 million per year), and about 560 million deaths (56 million per year). Conflict between Jewish and Arab communities in Israel and the West Bank have been ongoing since 1948. After Israel occupied the West Bank, it began making settlements there, which has been an obstacle to the peace process. Tensions also remained high as Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, has been launching rockets and cross-border raids into Israeli territory, which Israel has responded with force. The region of Karabakh has been disputed over the Republic of Artsakh, which is supported by the Armenian government. A ceasefire was held in 1994. From April 1–5, 2016, clashes began along the Nagorno-Karabakh line of contact with the Artsakh Defence Army, backed by the Armenian Armed Forces on one side and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces on the other. A ceasefire was reached on 5 April between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Moscow. From May 20–27, 2018, clashes in former no man's land in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, an exclave of Azerbaijan, led to Azerbaijan reoccupying Günnüt and several other strategic villages and positions. Motivated by the September 11 attacks, the United States and other governments started a large scale effort to eliminate terrorism. With support from NATO, the United States invaded Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and overthrew the government. Two years later, on the pretext that the government of Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, the United States and a coalition of partners invaded Iraq and overthrew Hussein, after which the U.S. occupied the country. However, insurgencies remained active in both countries, long after the invasions."
2010s,"Following United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, a NATO-led coalition launched an air campaign against Muammar Gaddafi's government in the Libyan Civil War. After the fall of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian soldiers took control of strategic positions in the Ukrainian territory of Crimea and subsequently annexed the region after a controversial referendum. In the months that followed, demonstrations in Donbas escalated into an armed conflict between the government of Ukraine and Russian-backed separatist forces. In late 2013, a terrorist organisation called the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant began making rapid advances and territorial gains in Iraq and Syria. It captured Mosul in June and made Raqqa its capital.[20] Various international coalitions led by the United States, France, Russia, and Muslim states and with aid from dozens of countries were formed to help fight the militants.[21][22] By December 2017, ISIL had lost all of its territory in Iraq and 95% of its territory in Syria, and was militarily and territorially defeated on 23 March 2019. During the Yemeni Civil War, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and other countries invaded parts of Yemen in order to depose the Houthi-controlled government. During the Syrian Civil War, Turkey invaded parts of northern Syria in order to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the Syrian Democratic Forces, fostering and funding the Syrian National Army of the Syrian Interim Government, culminating in its 2019 offensive into northeastern Syria in which over 300,000 civilians were displaced and dozens more killed, prompting a controversial reaction worldwide in response to reported human rights violations and resettlement of Kurds which has been viewed as possible ethnic cleansing."
2010s,"After a suicide car bombing on 14 February 2019 where 40 Indian security personnel are killed, the Indian Air Force launches airstrikes on purported terrorist camps in Muzaffarabad and Chakothi areas of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Balakot in mainland Pakistan, leading to said standoff. Also involved was Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistani militant group that took responsibility for the bombing and the purported target of Indian attacks. Low-intensity and asymmetrical between the Colombian government, left-wing guerrillas, and various paramilitary factions had been ongoing since 1964. However, at the start of the decade, only two major groups remained, FARC and ELN. Since 2012, both groups have been in peace talks with the government, with FARC and the government signing a historic ceasefire signed 23 June 2016. Though the peace deal was initially rejected by voters in October, a revised deal was successfully and unanimously passed by the Congress on 30 November 2016, bringing an end to much of the fighting that had been going on for almost 50 years. Since 2004, Pakistan has been fighting an insurgency by various armed militant groups aligned with the Taliban or ISIL in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa along its border with Afghanistan. The violence has killed at least 61,549 people since and over 6 million displaced, gutting the nation's economy and resources. By 2014, however, casualties from terrorist and militant attacks had dropped by around 40%, in spite of rampant massacres such as the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, which led to 156 deaths. Since 2005, Paraguay has been fighting a low-level insurgency by various Marxist–Leninist armed militant groups in the country, including the Paraguayan People's Army, the Armed Peasant Association, and the Army of Marshal López. Between 2005 and 2014, at least 50 have died alongside 28 kidnappings and 85 ""violent acts,"" concentrated in the highly populated northeastern departments of Amambay, Caaguazú, Canindeyú, Concepción, and San Pedro. Exact numbers vary, but the conflict is estimated to have caused a cumulative 111 deaths by 2020, most of which have been insurgents, local ranchers, and police officers."
2010s,"Following a rise in criminal violence as a result of increasingly influential drug trafficking in the country, Mexican President Felipe Calderón declared a war on drugs on 11 December 2006. Since the start of the war, the death toll from drug violence has sharply increased, with a death toll of nearly 300,000 over 60,000 missing, and 39,000 unidentified bodies in morgues. Arrests of key cartel leaders led to increasing violence as cartels, who dominate the billion-dollar illegal drug industry, fought for control of trafficking routes into the United States. The conflict has also emphasised corruption and human rights abuses, with bribery, drug smuggling, kidnapping, and protection of drug cartels being widely reported among government officials. In 2009, Al-Shabaab, an Islamist militant group, began waging an insurgency against the newly formed Transitional Federal Government. In 2011, the federal government captured Mogadishu and subsequently retook several towns across the country. Since then, the government has attempted to clean out the remaining Al-Shabaab strongholds with help from AMISOM soldiers and military intervention on the part of the United States. Al-Shabaab made a resurgence in 2016, when AMISOM and Kenyan forces were subject to multiple attacks and raids, to which American and Somali forces responded with increasingly intense airstrikes, weakening Al Shabaab's territorial prominence in the years following. The conflict has cost anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 lives and has devastated Somalia's infrastructure and humanitarian resources. In January 2012, a rebellion by Tuaregs in Northern Mali began. After Malian president Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted in a coup d'état, Tuaregs captured Northern Mali, and declared it to be the independent state of Azawad. However, shortly afterward, various Islamists groups took over Northern Mali from the Tuaregs and imposed sharia law on the region."
2010s,"The civil war began with the conquest of Fallujah, Mosul, Tikrit and major areas of northern Iraq by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Various nations provided aid in the form of airstrikes, troops and intelligence. On 9 December 2017, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced victory over ISIL, though others warned to expect ISIL to continue the fight by other means. Following the factional violence that engulfed Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, a second civil war broke out among rival factions seeking control of the territory and oil of Libya. The conflict at the beginning was mostly between the House of Representatives (HoR) government that was controversially elected in 2014, also known as the ""Tobruk government""; and the rival General National Congress (GNC) government, also called the ""National Salvation Government"", based in the capital Tripoli, established after Operation Odyssey Dawn and the failed military coup. A permanent ceasefire agreement in all areas of Libya became effective from 24 October 2020, ending the war. Preceded by a decade-long Houthi insurgency, the Yemeni Civil War began between two factions: the then-incumbent Yemeni government, led by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, and the Houthi militia, along with their supporters and allies. Both claim to constitute the Yemeni government. Following a rise in criminal violence as a result of drug trafficking in the country, since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was inaugurated on 30 June 2016. As of 2020, it has caused about 6000 deaths. In 2015 and 2016, a series of protests in Brazil denounced government corruption and the presidency of Dilma Rousseff, being the largest popular mobilisations in the country since the beginning of the ""New Republic"". Various political and civil groups led by member of parliament Nikol Pashinyan staged anti-government protests in Armenia. Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan resigned on 23 April 2018. Nikol Pashinyan was elected Prime Minister on 8 May 2018."
2010s,"Nation-wide protests mainly by students after reckless driving caused deaths of two high school students. France experiences its worst civil unrest since the protests of 1968 due to the yellow vests movement. Protests in Paris morph into riots, with hundreds of people injured and thousands arrested. Over 100 cars are burned and numerous tourist sites are closed. Amid mass protests, Omar al-Bashir is deposed as President of Sudan in a coup d'état, after nearly 30 years in office. Mass protests take place in Hong Kong against an extradition bill that many observed would subject Hong Kong residents and those passing through the city to de facto jurisdiction of Chinese Communist Party courts. Despite Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announcing the bill to be ""dead"" after weeks of mass protests, waves of localised demonstrations continued, some resulting in violent clashes between police, pro-democracy activists, local residents, and Triad members. On 3 October 2019, taxi, bus and truck drivers came out in protest against the planned fuel subsidy abolition and austerity measures announced by President Lenín Moreno. The government seat was relocated from Quito to Guayaquil and a state of emergency was declared following violent protests. On 18 October 2019, a period of mass protests and violent unrest began in Chile. The protests were initially in response to a fare hike on the Santiago Metro, but the scope of the protestors' demands has since expanded. Following a disputed election, protests forced Evo Morales, the president since 2006, to resign and flee to Mexico. The new president, Jeanine Áñez, continued to face opposition from pro-Morales protestors. Concerns over social and economic inequality, greed, corruption and the influence of corporations on government led to the rise of the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011."
2010s,"The Arab Spring was a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Islamic world in the early 2010s. It began in response to oppressive regimes and a low standard of living, starting with protests in Tunisia. In the news, social media has been heralded as the driving force behind the swift spread of revolution throughout the world, as new protests appear in response to success stories shared from those taking place in other countries. In many countries, the governments have also recognised the importance of social media for organising and have shut down certain sites or blocked Internet service entirely, especially in the times preceding a major rally. Governments have also scrutinised or suppressed discussion in those forums through accusing content creators of unrelated crimes or shutting down communication on specific sites or groups, such as through Facebook. Amidst anti-government protests, Tunisia's president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali dissolved the government, declared a state of emergency and resigned from office. Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, King of Bahrain, declared a three-month state of emergency as troops from the Gulf Co-operation Council were sent to quell the civil unrest. Facing protests against his 42-year rule, Muammar Gaddafi refused to step down and sent in the military to brutally quell protests. As a result, many army units defected to the opposition and protests soon turned into an armed rebellion. With international help, the rebels captured Tripoli, and eventually Sirte, Gaddafi's hometown and last outpost, where he was killed. Protests erupted in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad's rule, with police and the army sent in to crack down on protesters. They later morphed into war after army officers defected to the opposition, forming the Free Syrian Army (FSA). The war allowed for Islamic extremist groups like Al-Nusra Front and ISIL to temporarily take control of vast amounts of territory."
2010s,"On 8 April 2010, the United States and Russia signed a treaty in Prague, Czech Republic agreed to reduce the stockpiles of their nuclear weapons by half. It is meant to replace the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT), which was set to expire. The treaty went into force on 5 February 2011 after it was ratified by both nations. In 2015, Iran and other world powers agreed to trade sanctions relief for explicit constraints on Iran's contentious nuclear program, including allowing the inspections of nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). On 16 January 2016 the IAEA confirmed that Iran had complied with the agreement (the JCPOA), allowing the United Nations to lift sanctions immediately. However, on 8 May 2018, United States President Donald Trump announced the United States was withdrawing from the deal. On 7 July 2017, the United Nations passed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first legally binding international agreement to comprehensively prohibit nuclear weapons, with the goal of leading towards their total elimination. It has been signed by 58 nations. Throughout the decade, North Korea expanded its nuclear capabilities, performing alleged nuclear tests in 2013[135] and 2016,[136] which governments responded by placing international sanctions on the country. In response North Korea has threatened the United States, South Korea and Japan with pre-emptive nuclear strikes. However, in 2018, North Korea suggested that they may disarm their nuclear arsenal after negotiations with the United States. On 1 February 2019, The US formally suspended the Russo-American Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), and Russia did the same on the following day in response. The US formally withdrew from the treaty on 2 August 2019. The United States initiated a renovation of its nuclear weapon arsenal."
2010s,"China was increasingly called a superpower in the early 2010s, including at the 2011 meeting between President Hu Jintao and United States President Barack Obama. China overtook the U.S. as the world's largest trading nation, filing the most patents, expanding its military, landing its lunar rover Yutu on the moon (ending a four-decade lack of lunar exploration) and creating China's Oriental Movie Metropolis as a major film and cultural centre. In 2018, global military spending reached the highest it has been since 1988, late Cold War levels, largely fuelled by increased defence spending by China and the United States, whose budgets together accounted for half of the world's total military spending. In 2019, the Lowy Institute Asia Power Index, which measures the projections of power in the Indo-Pacific, called both China and the United States the superpowers of the 21st century, citing immense influence in almost all eight indexes of power. Along with China, President Vladimir Putin led Russia also steadily increased its defence spending and continued to modernise its military capabilities throughout the decade, including the development of the T-14 Armata main battle tank and the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 jet fighter. Russia also flexed its power projection capabilities, particularly demonstrated during the 2014 annexation of Crimea and its interventions in eastern Ukraine and the Syrian Civil War; Wagner Group had a significant presence in both conflicts. Russia also notably waged information warfare campaigns against its geopolitical foes, including interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections via hacking and leaking emails of U.S. political party leadership and by spreading disinformation via the Internet Research Agency. Other alleged Russian intelligence operations included the Skripal poisonings and the Montenegrin coup plot, both of which were attributed by some to the Unit 29155 organisation. Collectively, these activities—and the Western-led efforts to combat the influence of Russian oligarchs and political interests—have been referred to as the Second Cold War."
2010s,"The European Union went through several crises. The European debt crisis caused severe economic problems to several eurozone member states, most severely Greece. The 2015 migration crisis led to several million people entering the EU illegally in a short period of time. There was a significant rise in the vote shares of several eurosceptic parties, including the League in Italy, Alternative for Germany, and the Finns Party in Finland. As a result of a referendum, the United Kingdom became the first member state in the EU's history to initiate proceedings for leaving the Union. Socio-political polarisation increased as conservatives and social liberals clashed over the role and size of government and other social, economic and environmental issues in the West. In the United States, polls showed a divided electorate regarding healthcare reform, immigration, gun rights, taxation, job creation, and debt reduction. In Europe, movements protesting increasing numbers of refugees and migrants from Islamic countries developed, such as the English Defence League and Pegida. The trend of polarisation in the West was partially influenced by the prevalence of identity politics, both left-wing and right-wing, among activist movements. Beginning around 2011, far-left and progressive concepts such as combating social inequality and economic inequality, often via progressive stack tactics, proliferated in the Western world and elsewhere. Around the middle of the decade, phenomenon such as white nationalism, identitarianism and emboldened feelings of nativism saw a marked reemergence in the West due to drastically increased migration and corresponding crime and amongst both the right and left general dissatisfaction with Western government and Media responses to certain issues. There were also increased calls for egalitarianism, including between the sexes,[196] and some scholars assert that a fourth wave of feminism began around 2012, with a primary focus on intersectionality."
2010s,"Populism in politics saw a widespread surge throughout the decade, with many politicians and various political movements expressing populist sentiments and utilising populist rhetoric. This included conservative wave phenomenon in Latin America and neo-nationalist fervor in Europe and North America. The 2019 European Parliament election saw the highest voter turnout in two decades and saw relatively moderate centre-right and centre-left parties suffer significant losses to less moderate far-right, environmentalist, and both pro-EU and eurosceptic parties, who made gains. Examples of 2010s populist movements included the Tea Party movement, Occupy Wall Street, Brexit, Black Lives Matter, and the alt-right. Examples of populist country leaders were just as extensive, with Donald Trump, Narendra Modi, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Hugo Chávez, Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro, Rodrigo Duterte, and Boris Johnson, left and right-wing, described as such. Related to the rise of populism and protests movements was the decline of traditional political parties. In Europe, pasokification described the loss of vote share experienced by traditional centre-left or social democratic parties. In France, specifically, Emmanuel Macron's La République En Marche! party won a majority in its first election in 2017. Centre-left, neoliberal and traditional social democratic parties often lost their vote share to more socialist or democratic socialist alternatives, especially in Europe. This happened most completely in Greece, where PASOK was replaced by Syriza as the main left-wing party. Other far-left parties which rose in prominence included Podemos in Spain and La France Insoumise in France. In the two-party systems of the English-speaking world, these challenges mainly came from within the established parties of the left, with Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party and Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour Party pushing for more left-wing policies."
2010s,"The political establishment was also challenged in many countries by protest movements, often organised through new social media platforms. These included the various Arab Spring protests, the Occupy movement, and the yellow vests movement. Sitting world leaders such as Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, Kim Jong-il of North Korea, Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, Lech Kaczyński of Poland, Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan and Beji Caid Essebsi of Tunisia, all died in office, as did former leaders Fidel Castro, Lee Kuan Yew, Nelson Mandela, Margaret Thatcher, Robert Mugabe, Giulio Andreotti, Francesco Cossiga, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Jacques Chirac, Helmut Schmidt, Helmut Kohl, Mohamed Morsi, Ariel Sharon, Shimon Peres, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Václav Havel, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, B. J. Habibie, Yasuhiro Nakasone, Alan García, Jorge Rafael Videla, Néstor Kirchner, Fernando de la Rúa, Patricio Aylwin, Itamar Franco, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and George H. W. Bush. The Arab Winter refers to the resurgence of authoritarianism, absolute monarchies and Islamic extremism evolving in the aftermath of the Arab Spring protests in Arab countries. The term ""Arab Winter"" refers to the events across Arab League countries in the Mid-East and North Africa, including the Syrian Civil War, the Iraqi insurgency and the following civil war, the Egyptian Crisis, the Libyan Crisis and the Crisis in Yemen. Events referred to as the Arab Winter include those in Egypt that led to the removal of Mohamed Morsi and the seizure of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in an anti-Muslim Brotherhood campaign. In 2018, China's National People's Congress approved a constitutional change that removed term limits for its leaders, granting Xi Jinping the status of ""leader for life"". Xi is the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (de facto leader)."

The 2010s were marked by increasing awareness and concern about the impacts of climate change. Many of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters, including the United States, China, and the European Union, pledged to reduce their emissions and take action to mitigate climate change. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, set a goal of limiting global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Despite these efforts, global carbon emissions continued to rise throughout the decade, and the impacts of climate change became increasingly visible. Heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and extreme weather events became more frequent and severe, and sea levels continued to rise, threatening low-lying areas and coastal communities. The 2010s also saw growing activism and advocacy around climate change, with young people and indigenous communities taking a leading role in demanding action from governments and corporations. The decade ended with a sense of urgency and a growing recognition of the need for immediate and ambitious action to address the climate crisis."
2010s,"The 2010s saw a continuation of the global trend towards urbanization, with more people than ever before living in cities. The world's urban population surpassed 4 billion in 2015, and is projected to reach 5 billion by 2030. This trend was particularly pronounced in developing countries, where rapid economic growth and rural-to-urban migration led to the rapid expansion of cities. Urbanization had both positive and negative impacts in the 2010s. On the one hand, cities offered new opportunities for economic growth, innovation, and cultural exchange, and played a key role in driving global development. On the other hand, rapid urbanization also led to a range of social and environmental challenges, including congestion, pollution, inequality, and inadequate infrastructure and services. The 2010s also saw a growing recognition of the need for sustainable urban development, with cities around the world adopting strategies to promote green growth, reduce carbon emissions, and improve livability. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, adopted in 2015, included a specific goal focused on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Looking ahead, urbanization is expected to continue to shape the global landscape in the coming decades, with implications for everything from climate change to public health to social and political stability. As such, the need for thoughtful and effective urban planning and governance has never been greater. Heavy rainfall generated by the annual northeast monsoon affected the Coromandel Coast region of the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. More than 500 people were killed and over 1.8 million people were displaced. With estimates of damages and losses ranging from nearly 200 billion (US3 billion) to over 1 trillion (US14 billion), the floods were the costliest to have occurred in 2015, and were among the costliest natural disasters of the year."
2010s,"The 2010s were marked by growing awareness and concern about the urgent need to transition to more sustainable and resilient ways of living, working, and consuming. This was driven by a range of environmental, social, and economic challenges, including climate change, biodiversity loss, inequality, and resource scarcity. Sustainability became a mainstream topic of discussion in the 2010s, with governments, businesses, and civil society organizations all recognizing the need to take action to address these challenges. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, adopted in 2015, set a framework for global action on sustainability, with targets ranging from ending poverty and hunger to promoting sustainable production and consumption. In the 2010s, there were many examples of progress towards sustainability, including the rapid growth of renewable energy, the emergence of circular economy models, and the development of innovative technologies for sustainable agriculture and transportation. At the same time, there were also many challenges and obstacles to progress, including political resistance, market barriers, and the scale and complexity of the problems being addressed. Looking ahead, the need for sustainability is only set to become more urgent, as the impacts of climate change and other sustainability challenges continue to be felt around the world. The 2020s will require bold and decisive action from all sectors of society, including governments, businesses, and individuals, to create a more sustainable and just future for all. Between 13 and 18 May 2014 a low pressure cyclone designated ""Tamara"" and ""Yvette"" affected a large area of Southeastern and Central Europe, causing floods and landslides. Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered the greatest damage as the rain was the heaviest in 120 years of recorded weather measurements. At least 86 people were killed and hundreds of thousands had been forced from their homes. Assessments of damage range up to 3.5 billion euros for Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina."
2010s,"The 2010s were marked by a series of economic crises around the world, which had far-reaching impacts on individuals, businesses, and governments. These crises were triggered by a range of factors, including the global financial system, political instability, and natural disasters. One of the most significant economic crises of the decade was the European debt crisis, which began in 2009 and lasted for several years. This crisis was triggered by a combination of factors, including the global financial crisis, high levels of debt among European countries, and structural flaws in the Eurozone. The crisis led to high levels of unemployment, social unrest, and political instability across the region. Other economic crises in the 2010s included the economic fallout from natural disasters, such as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011, and the economic impacts of political instability, such as the crisis in Venezuela. These crises led to widespread suffering and hardship, as well as complex political and social challenges. The response to these economic crises was varied and complex, with different countries and regions adopting different strategies for recovery. These strategies ranged from austerity measures and structural reforms to stimulus spending and debt relief. While some countries were able to recover relatively quickly, others are still grappling with the long-term impacts of these crises. Looking ahead, the need for robust and resilient economic systems has never been greater, as the world faces ongoing economic challenges, as well as new and emerging threats such as climate change and technological disruption. The 2020s will require innovative thinking, bold action, and collaborative partnerships to create a more equitable and sustainable global economy. Eruptions of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland caused unprecedented disruption to international air travel, rendering transatlantic flight impossible and closing airways across much of Europe. The event was the largest air traffic shut-down since World War II."
2010s,"Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is believed by Christians to be the Son of God and the savior of humanity. The religion emerged in the first century AD in the Middle East and has since spread around the world, becoming one of the largest religions in the world with over 2 billion followers. At the core of Christian belief is the idea that salvation and eternal life are obtained through faith in Jesus Christ and adherence to his teachings. Central to Christian worship is the celebration of the sacraments, including baptism and the Eucharist, as well as regular prayer and devotion to God. The Christian church has undergone significant evolution and change over the centuries, with different branches and denominations emerging over time. These include the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and Protestant denominations such as Anglican, Lutheran, and Baptist. Christianity has had a profound impact on world history, influencing art, literature, and culture. It has also been a major force in social and political movements, from the abolition of slavery to the civil rights movement. The religion has also faced challenges and criticisms, including accusations of intolerance and historical controversies such as the Crusades and the Inquisition. Today, Christianity remains a vibrant and diverse religion, with followers and communities around the world practicing a wide range of traditions and customs. As the world faces new challenges and opportunities in the 21st century, the role of Christianity and its followers will continue to evolve and shape the course of human history. Mount Merapi erupted in Indonesia, killing 353 people and grounding flights across Southeast Asia, becoming the largest eruption from the mountain in a century."
2010s,"Cleopatra VII was the last pharaoh of ancient Egypt and is remembered for her intelligence, beauty, and political savvy. She was born in 69 BC and was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which had ruled Egypt since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. Cleopatra was a shrewd political operator who knew how to wield power and influence. She was known for her charm and charisma and was skilled at negotiating with powerful leaders, including Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Her romantic relationships with both men became the subject of legend and have been immortalized in art and literature. Cleopatra was also a patron of the arts and sciences and is believed to have been well-educated in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. She was also known for her strategic thinking and military leadership, although her reign was marked by a series of conflicts and wars. Cleopatra's reign came to an end in 30 BC when she died by suicide, following the defeat of her forces by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. Her legacy as a powerful and influential leader has endured to this day, and she remains a fascinating figure in history and popular culture. Throughout history, Cleopatra has been the subject of many books, plays, and films, with her story continuing to captivate and inspire audiences around the world. Her life and reign have been the subject of ongoing debate and discussion among scholars, with many still trying to unravel the mysteries and contradictions of this remarkable woman. A wildfire began southwest of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.

Joseph Stalin was a Soviet politician and dictator who ruled the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. Born in Georgia in 1878, Stalin rose to power within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union after the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924. Stalin's leadership was marked by a brutal regime of repression and political purges, as well as a policy of rapid industrialization and collectivization. He oversaw the forced resettlement of millions of people, many of whom died due to harsh living conditions and lack of resources. Stalin's government also played a crucial role in World War II, leading the Soviet Union to victory over Nazi Germany. However, his policies and actions resulted in the deaths of millions of people, both through direct violence and through famine and other forms of suffering. Stalin was known for his cult of personality, which helped to maintain his power and control over the Soviet Union. His regime was characterized by censorship, propaganda, and a pervasive atmosphere of fear and mistrust. Stalin's legacy is complex and controversial, with some viewing him as a hero who led the Soviet Union to victory in World War II, while others see him as a ruthless dictator who was responsible for the deaths of millions of people. His reign had a profound impact on the course of world history, shaping the geopolitical landscape of the 20th century and beyond. The 2019 Australian bushfire season arrived in the wake of heavy droughts across the country, with fires covering the east coast including the metropolitan confines of Sydney.
