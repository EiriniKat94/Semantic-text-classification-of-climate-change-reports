Semantic text classification of climate change reports for natural disasters and their impacts on places through time
The folder is made up of the training set that we used for our model and has a folder for natural disasters, one for locations, one on impacts and one for time periods and the test set which is the IPCC climate change report of 2022 (IPCC, 2022) randomly divided into 5 equal-sized subgroups.
